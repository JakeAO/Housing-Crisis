# Underground: The Dystopian World

## The Premise

Welcome to the **near future**—or more accurately, the worst-case present stretched to its breaking point.

Everything is privatized. Everything is branded. Everything is for sale. The government exists primarily to enforce corporate contracts and maintain the fiction that things are getting better. The media reports what their sponsors tell them to report. And if you're not useful to the machine, you're spare parts.

This is **Underground**: a satirical superhero dystopia where the American Dream died of corporate-sponsored malnutrition and consumer debt.

## How We Got Here

### The Corporate Consolidation (1990s-2010s)

It happened gradually, then suddenly:

1. **Privatization of Public Services:** Police, fire departments, prisons, schools—all outsourced to "efficiency consultants" (mega-corporations)
2. **Media Monopolization:** Six corporations own all news, entertainment, and information
3. **Government Capture:** Politicians became corporate board members became politicians in endless revolving doors
4. **The Social Safety Net Collapse:** Welfare, healthcare, pensions—replaced with "personal responsibility" (starvation)
5. **The Resource Wars:** Secret conflicts over oil, water, and rare earth minerals created the need for super-soldiers

**The result:** A world where corporations have more power than nations, the government serves capital over citizens, and the average person is one medical emergency from total ruin.

### The Slushie Program (2020s-2030s)

When conventional soldiers weren't expendable enough, the government created you:

- **Genetic Engineering:** Volunteers (and "volunteers") underwent experimental bioengineering
- **Combat Conditioning:** Psychological programming to suppress empathy and maximize lethality
- **Classified Deployments:** Fought in wars the public doesn't know happened
- **Plausible Deniability:** If captured, you don't exist. If you die, your family gets nothing.

You survived. Most didn't. Your reward? Paradise Heights.

## The Power Structure

### Mega-Corporations

The real rulers of society. Each controls entire industries:

**Omni-Consumer (OmniCon):**
- Consumer goods, food production (Tastee-Goo!)
- "From Cradle to Grave, OmniCon Cares!"
- Controls: grocery chains, drug stores, funerals

**TechDyne Solutions:**
- Electronics, cybernetics, surveillance systems
- "Tomorrow's Tech, Today's Problems Solved!"
- Controls: personal tech, security systems, data mining

**Sentinel Security Corporation:**
- Private police (Rent-A-Cops), prisons, armed forces
- "Your Safety, Our Priority (Terms & Conditions Apply)"
- Controls: law enforcement, judicial process, bail bonds

**MediaFirst Entertainment:**
- News, television, movies, social media
- "Your Truth, Delivered Fresh Daily!"
- Controls: information flow, public opinion, celebrity culture

**MedCorp Health Solutions:**
- Healthcare, pharmaceuticals, insurance
- "Quality Care for Quality People!" (Credit Check Required)
- Controls: hospitals, doctors, ambulances

**National Resource Industries (NRI):**
- Energy, water, construction, real estate
- "Building America's Future!" (Demolishing Your Present)
- Controls: utilities, housing, infrastructure

### The Government

**What it pretends to be:** A functional democracy serving the people

**What it actually is:** A customer service department for corporations

**Key Features:**
- Elections are theatre (corporate-funded candidates only)
- Laws protect property over people
- Military exists to secure corporate interests abroad
- Police enforce debt collection and eviction notices
- Politicians rotate into corporate boards after "public service"

### Rent-A-Cops (Sentinel Security)

The privatized police force:

**What they claim to do:** Protect and serve the community

**What they actually do:**
- Extort protection money from residents
- Shake down small businesses
- Ignore crimes against poor people
- Brutalize anyone who can't afford legal representation
- Serve corporate interests over public safety

**Why they're allowed:** They're cheaper than real cops and won't unionize

**Why they're dangerous:** No oversight, no accountability, corporate profit motive

### The Media

**News = Entertainment = Advertising = Propaganda**

Every story serves a sponsor:

- **Crime Reports:** Brought to you by Sentinel Security ("See? You need us!")
- **Health Scares:** Sponsored by MedCorp ("Better get that checked!")
- **Economic News:** Presented by OmniCon ("Consumer confidence is up!")
- **Celebrity Gossip:** The only news that doesn't threaten the system

**Underground Rule:** If it's on TV, it's a lie. If it's true, it's not on TV.

## Daily Life in the Dystopia

### Economic Reality

**Average Citizen:**
- Works 60+ hours per week
- Lives paycheck-to-paycheck (if employed)
- Drowning in debt (medical, student, consumer)
- One emergency from homelessness
- Life expectancy declining

**The Wealthy:**
- Live in gated communities (literal walls)
- Private security, private healthcare, private everything
- Never see the poor except on TV (crime statistics)
- Consider poverty a moral failing

**The Gap:**
- CEO makes 500x average worker
- Minimum wage hasn't changed in 20 years
- Cost of living doubles every decade
- Social mobility is statistically zero

### Tastee-Goo and Consumer Culture

**Tastee-Goo:** The cheap, nutritionally-adequate, completely artificial food substance that feeds the masses.

**Flavors:**
- Beef-Style
- Chicken-Style
- Pizza-Style
- Breakfast-Style
- "Luxury" Steak-Style (for special occasions)

**Advertising:** "Tastee-Goo! It's Food Enough!"™

**Reality:** Made from processed soybeans, food waste, and chemicals you can't pronounce. It won't kill you (probably). It barely qualifies as food. But it's all most people can afford.

**The Sad Part:** Real food exists. Real meat, real vegetables, real bread. The wealthy eat it. You can't.

### Technology Level

**What Exists:**
- Cybernetic enhancements (if you can afford them)
- Surveillance everywhere (cameras, drones, implants)
- Advanced robotics (replacing workers)
- AI systems (making decisions about your life)
- Virtual reality (escape is cheaper than revolution)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Public infrastructure (roads, bridges, water systems)
- Social services (hospitals, schools, libraries)
- Any system serving the public good

**The Rule:** If it makes money, it's cutting-edge. If it costs money, it's broken.

### Healthcare

**If you're rich:** Medical miracles, life extension, cybernetic upgrades

**If you're poor:** 
- Hope you don't get sick
- Hope you don't get injured
- Hope you die quickly if you do

**MedCorp's Motto:** "Quality Care for Quality People!"  
**Translation:** "If you can't pay, die somewhere else."

**Insurance:** Exists primarily to deny coverage and maximize profit

**Emergency Rooms:** Legally required to stabilize you, then send you a bill that ruins your life
