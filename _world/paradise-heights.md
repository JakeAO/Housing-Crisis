## Neo-L.A. (Formerly Los Angeles)

After the Big One (the 8.9 earthquake of 2027) and the subsequent corporate "reconstruction," Los Angeles became **Neo-L.A.**—a monument to inequality, urban decay, and corporate branding.

### The Geography of Class

**The Skyline (Upper Neo-L.A.):**
- Corporate headquarters pierce the smog layer
- Gated sky-rises with private security
- Helipads for executive transport
- Never touch ground level
- Population: The wealthy and their servants

**The Grid (Mid Neo-L.A.):**
- Functioning urban districts
- Corporate campuses, shopping centers, entertainment zones
- Police (real police) might actually respond to calls
- Middle class clings to employment
- Population: Workers, middle management, professionals

**The Zones (Lower Neo-L.A.):**
- Crumbling infrastructure, gang territories, desperation
- Where Paradise Heights is located
- Rent-A-Cops collect protection money
- Real cops don't avoid it
- Population: The poor, the desperate, the forgotten
- **This is your world now.**

### Key Districts

**Corporate Center:**
- Where decisions about your life are made
- Pristine, surveilled, militarized
- You're not welcome here (and you know it)

**The Grid - Commerce Zone:**
- Shopping, entertainment, "normal" life
- Where Tastee-Goo is sold alongside "real food" (at 10x price)
- Gangs occasionally raid, quickly suppressed

**The Zones - Paradise Heights Neighborhood:**
- Your home territory
- 40-story housing project (half the elevators work)
- Surrounded by gang territories (Red Kings, Chrome Disciples, Dead Street Tribe)
- Adjacent to industrial wasteland and old harbor
- Population: 15,000+ desperate people

**The Wastes:**
- Earthquake ruins never rebuilt
- Toxic waste dumps
- Homeless encampments
- Where corpses disappear
- Surprisingly, sometimes easier to survive than The Zones

## Paradise Heights: Your Home

### The Complex

**Official Name:** Paradise Heights Luxury Veterans' Residence  
**Reality:** A 40-story crumbling housing project

**From the Brochure:**
- "State-of-the-art facilities for our heroes"
- "24/7 security and medical care"
- "Community recreation and job training"
- "Luxury accommodations befitting your service"
- "A new start in beautiful Neo-L.A.!"

**The Truth:**
- Half the elevators don't work (stairs or nothing)
- Water is contaminated (brown, tastes metallic)
- "Security" are extorting Rent-A-Cops
- Medical clinic closed years ago
- Gangs control ground floors
- Buildings literally crumbling
- Most residents are desperate civilians, not veterans

### The Buildings

Paradise Heights consists of five connected towers:

**Tower A (North):** 
- Most structurally sound
- Where Rent-A-Cops have their "precinct"
- Residential floors relatively safe
- Still terrible, just less terrible

**Tower B (East):**
- Red Kings gang territory (floors 1-8)
- Civilians trapped above gang territory
- Elevators frequently sabotaged
- Drug labs on lower floors

**Tower C (Central):**
- Your building
- Mixed residents, no dominant gang (yet)
- Community attempts to organize here
- Most damaged infrastructure

**Tower D (West):**
- Chrome Disciples territory (floors 1-6)
- Electronics chop shop
- Stolen tech marketplace
- Booby-trapped stairwells

**Tower E (South):**
- Mostly abandoned
- Structural damage from earthquake
- Squatters, homeless, desperate
- Dangerous even by Paradise Heights standards

### Ground Level

**The Courtyard (The Arena):**
- Open space between towers
- Gang fights, public executions, "justice"
- Don't go alone
- Don't go unarmed
- Don't go after dark

**The Lobby (Tower C):**
- Broken glass, graffiti, blood stains
- Mailboxes looted years ago
- Security desk abandoned
- Your first view of "paradise"

**The Perimeter:**
- Chain-link fence (holes everywhere)
- "Security" checkpoint (extortion point)
- Gang lookouts watching entrances
- Homeless camp outside walls

### The Residents

**15,000+ people live in Paradise Heights:**

**Veterans (10%):**
- Slushies (super-soldiers) like you
- Regular veterans (baseline human)
- Mostly suffering PTSD, substance issues, disability
- Betrayed by the system that made them

**Civilians (90%):**
- Evicted from elsewhere
- Economic refugees
- Families with nowhere else to go
- People who made bad choices or bad luck
- Not bad people—desperate people

**Gang Members (5%, overlap with above):**
- Locals who joined for protection/income
- Some genuinely violent
- Most just trying to survive
- Few have other options

**The Vulnerable:**
- Children (too many)
- Elderly (sick, alone)
- Disabled (no accommodations)
- Mentally ill (no treatment)
- **These are who you're really protecting**

## The Neighboring Zones

**Meat Market District (North):**
- Black market everything
- Where gangs sell stolen goods
- Where you can buy anything (if you have money)
- Neutral ground (sort of)

**Industrial Wastes (South):**
- Abandoned factories
- Toxic dump sites
- Homeless encampments
- Occasionally corporate warehouses (poorly guarded)

**Harbor Ruins (West):**
- Old shipping docks (pre-earthquake)
- Smuggling hub
- More dangerous than Paradise Heights
- Useful for covert resource acquisition

**Grid Border (East):**
- The divide between Zones and Grid
- Checkpoints, surveillance, walls
- Where the "respectable" world pretends you don't exist
- Where you can see how the other half lives
