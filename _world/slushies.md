summary: History and reality of genetically engineered veterans

## The Name

"Slushie" is military slang—sometimes affectionate, sometimes derogatory—for genetically engineered super-soldiers.

The name comes from the **cryogenic suspension tanks** used during the bioengineering process. Recruits spent weeks in semi-frozen "slush" while nanomachines rewrote their DNA. The slang stuck.

**What you call yourselves:**
- "Slushies" (reclaimed the term)
- "Enhanced Personnel" (official military designation)
- "Gene-Freaks" (what baseline soldiers called you)
- "The Modified" (clinical term)
- Just "soldiers" (you did the same job, better)

## The Program History

### Phase 1: Recruitment (2020s)

The military needed volunteers for an "experimental enhancement program."

**Where they found volunteers:**
- Prison inmates (reduced sentences)
- Economic desperates (signing bonuses)
- Terminally ill (promised cures)
- Idealistic patriots (believed the pitch)
- People with nothing left to lose

**The Pitch:** "Serve your country. Become more than human. Receive full benefits."

**The Reality:** 40% mortality rate during enhancement. Survivors were experimental weapons.

**You were one of the survivors.**

### Phase 2: Enhancement (2020s-2030s)

The bioengineering process was brutal:

**Week 1-2: Genetic Mapping**
- Full DNA analysis
- Baseline testing
- Psychological profiling
- No turning back after this point

**Week 3-6: Cryogenic Modification**
- Suspended in slush tanks
- Nanomachine genetic restructuring  
- Conscious but paralyzed (worst part)
- Pain beyond description
- Some screamed in the tanks. Some went mad.

**Week 7-10: Stabilization**
- Monitoring for rejection
- Many died here (organs failed, cancer, hemorrhaging)
- Survivors showed superhuman traits
- Each person enhanced differently (random mutations)

**Week 11-16: Combat Conditioning**
- Physical training with new abilities
- Psychological programming (suppress empathy, maximize aggression)
- Weapons training
- Tactical doctrine
- You became a weapon

**Success Rate:** 60% survived. Of those, 80% were combat-effective.

**You were one of the combat-effective survivors.**

### Phase 3: Deployment (2025-2040)

Where did Slushies fight? Officially, nowhere. Unofficially:

**Central American Brush Wars (2025-2028):**
- Corporate resource conflicts disguised as civil wars
- Securing oil fields, rare earth mines, water rights
- Plausible deniability operations
- No uniforms, no insignia, no official records
- **You were there.**

**Middle Eastern "Peacekeeping" (2028-2032):**
- Protecting corporate infrastructure
- Eliminating "insurgents" (locals defending their land)
- Collateral damage accepted as cost of operations
- Media never reported it
- **Maybe you were there.**

**Asian Corporate Wars (2032-2038):**
- Fighting other corporate super-soldiers
- Slushie vs. Slushie combat
- Entire cities destroyed
- Populations displaced
- World pretended it wasn't happening
- **Probably you were there.**

**Domestic "Security Operations" (2035-2040):**
- Suppressing riots, protests, strikes
- Used against American citizens
- This is when some Slushies started questioning orders
- This is when some were "retired"
- **This might be why you're out.**

### Phase 4: Discharge (2038-2045)

Eventually, the program wound down:

**Official Reasons:**
- "Mission accomplished"
- "Budget reallocations"
- "Advancements in drone warfare"

**Real Reasons:**
- Too expensive
- Too many questions from oversight
- Some Slushies started refusing orders
- Public was getting suspicious
- Easier to replace with robots

**What They Promised:** 
- "Veteran's Paradise" - luxury housing, full benefits, healthcare, respect
- "A new life befitting heroes"
- "America takes care of its own"

**What You Got:**
- Paradise Heights (condemned housing project)
- $500/month pension (barely subsistence)
- No healthcare (experimental modifications "not covered")
- PTSD with no treatment
- The lie exposed

## Psychological Cost

### The Conditioning

You were programmed to be a weapon:

**Aggression Enhancement:**
- Suppress empathy in combat
- Maximize threat assessment
- React violently to danger
- Difficulty de-escalating

**Loyalty Programming:**
- Follow orders without question
- Trust chain of command
- Distrust outsiders
- Difficulty thinking independently

**Dehumanization Training:**
- Enemies aren't people, they're targets
- Collateral damage is acceptable
- Mission success over human cost
- Guilt is weakness

**The Problem:** The programming doesn't turn off. You still have these reflexes.

### Common Psychological Issues

**PTSD Symptoms:**
- Flashbacks to combat
- Hypervigilance (always alert)
- Insomnia (can't relax)
- Emotional numbing
- Survivor's guilt

**Rage Issues:**
- Hair-trigger temper
- Disproportionate responses
- Difficulty controlling strength
- Hurting people accidentally

**Trust Problems:**
- Authority figures trigger hostility
- Difficulty forming relationships
- Paranoia about being betrayed (they lied about paradise)
- Isolation as self-protection

**Substance Dependency:**
- Government-issued "stress management" drugs (addictive)
- Self-medication with alcohol/drugs
- Anything to quiet the memories
- Anything to feel normal

**Identity Crisis:**
- What are you without orders?
- Are you still human?
- Can you be more than a weapon?
- What purpose beyond war?

### Coping Mechanisms

**Healthy:**
- Community connection (why Paradise Heights matters)
- Purpose beyond violence (Social Change goals)
- Protecting others (rechanneling protective instincts)
- Building instead of destroying

**Unhealthy:**
- Violence as stress relief
- Isolation from "normal" people
- Substance abuse
- Seeking combat situations

## How Baseline Humans See You

### Fear and Awe

**You're superhuman:**
- Can lift cars
- Can run faster than vehicles
- Can shrug off gunfire
- Can kill with your bare hands

**Civilians are terrified and amazed:**
- Keep distance (self-preservation)
- Ask for autographs (celebrity culture)
- Demand protection (expectation)
- Report you to authorities (threat)

### Resentment

**"You're dangerous freaks":**
- Not natural
- Government experiments gone wrong
- Too powerful for civilian areas
- Should be controlled or eliminated

**This is often coded language for:**
- We don't want you in our neighborhood
- You remind us the government does horrible things
- You're poor and we can blame genetics

### Exploitation

**Various groups want to use you:**
- Gangs want enforcers
- Corporations want security
- Government wants deniable assets
- Media wants sensational stories

## Slushie Culture and Community

### Unspoken Bonds

Slushies recognize each other:

**Physical Tells:**
- Movement patterns (enhanced reflexes)
- Scars (specific to enhancement procedures)
- Eyes (thousand-yard stare, modified irises)
- Posture (always ready for combat)

**Behavioral Tells:**
- Hypervigilance
- Tactical thinking
- Dark humor about shared experiences
- Understanding the cost

**When Slushies meet:**
- Respect is given (you survived what most didn't)
- Stories are shared (who did you serve with?)
- Support is offered (we take care of our own)
- Judgment is rare (we've all done things)

*You were made to destroy. Can you choose to build instead?*
