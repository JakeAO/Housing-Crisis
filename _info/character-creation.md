## What is a Slushie?

"Slushie" is military slang for a genetically engineered super-soldier. The name comes from the cryogenic "slush" tanks used during the bioengineering process. You survived genetic modification, combat conditioning, psychological programming, and multiple covert wars. The government promised you paradise. They gave you a war zone.

## Character Concept

Start with a strong concept that answers these questions:

1. **What branch of service?**
2. **What was your specialty?**
3. **What theatres did you fight in?**
4. **What broke you?**
5. **What keeps you going?**

## Attributes

Underground uses six attributes rated from 1-10 (human average is 3-4):

- **Strength (STR):** Raw physical power and durability
- **Dexterity (DEX):** Agility, reflexes, and coordination  
- **Constitution (CON):** Endurance and resistance to damage
- **Intelligence (INT):** Problem-solving and technical knowledge
- **Willpower (WIL):** Mental fortitude and self-control
- **Charisma (CHA):** Social influence and leadership

**Starting Attributes:** You have **40 points** to distribute. Slushies typically have at least one attribute at 6+ due to genetic enhancement.

**Recommended Distributions:**
- **Combat Specialist:** STR 7, DEX 6, CON 7, INT 3, WIL 5, CHA 3
- **Infiltrator:** STR 4, DEX 8, CON 5, INT 5, WIL 6, CHA 4
- **Leader:** STR 5, DEX 5, CON 5, INT 6, WIL 6, CHA 5

## Powers

Every Slushie has 2-3 superhuman abilities from their genetic engineering. Powers are rated in levels (typically 1-5 for starting characters).

### Power Generation Method

**Point Buy**
- You have **15 Power Points** to spend
- Powers cost: Level 1 = 2 pts, Level 2 = 4 pts, Level 3 = 6 pts, Level 4 = 8 pts, Level 5 = 10 pts
- Example: Enhanced Strength 3 (6 pts) + Regeneration 2 (4 pts) + Enhanced Reflexes 2 (4 pts) = 14 pts

### Common Slushie Powers

**Physical Enhancement:**
- Enhanced Strength, Durability, Speed, Reflexes, Senses
- Regeneration (heal damage rapidly)

### Power Limitations

All Slushie powers have drawbacks:

1. **Collateral Damage:** Using powers at high levels causes destruction
2. **Energy Drain:** Extended use causes fatigue
3. **Psychological Stress:** Powers activate your combat conditioning (flashbacks, aggression)
4. **Visibility:** Using obvious powers attracts corporate/gang attention

## Background

Define your character's history:

1. **Pre-Military Life:** Where did you come from? (Most Slushies recruited from desperate circumstances)
2. **Military Service:** What did you do? What did you see?
3. **The Lie:** What did they promise you about Veteran's Paradise?
4. **The Reality:** How did you react when you saw the real Paradise Heights?
5. **Your Goal:** What part of fixing this place matters most to you?

## Equipment

Standard Slushie starting gear:

- **Worn Combat Fatigues**
- **Personal Sidearm**
- **Military Knife** 
- **Veteran's ID Card** (mostly useless but technically grants benefits)
- **Backpack** with basic supplies
- **$500 in Cash** (your first month's "pension")
- **One Personal Item** (something that keeps you human)

## Complications

Every Slushie has psychological complications from their service:

**Roll or Choose One:**
1. **PTSD Flashbacks** - Certain triggers cause combat responses
2. **Trust Issues** - Authority figures trigger hostility
3. **Survivor's Guilt** - Lost too many friends in service
4. **Substance Dependency** - Using government-issue meds or worse
5. **Rage Issues** - Difficulty controlling anger when stressed
6. **Paranoia** - They lied about paradise. What else did they lie about?

**Complications earn you bonus XP when they create problems for your character.**

## Character Advancement

You gain Experience Points (XP) for:
- Completing missions
- Improving neighborhood stats (Social Change)
- Good roleplay
- Overcoming complications

*Remember: You're powerful but not invincible. Your powers come with psychological baggage. And using them too openly brings unwanted attention.*
