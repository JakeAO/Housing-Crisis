## Combat Overview

Underground combat is fast, deadly, and messy. Your superhuman abilities make you powerful—but not invincible. And every fight has consequences.

## Basic Combat Flow

**1. Initiative:** Roll DEX + d10. Highest goes first.

**2. Actions per Round:**
- **Standard Action:** Attack, use power, complex action
- **Move Action:** Move up to your speed
- **Free Action:** Draw weapon, shout, drop item

**3. Attack Roll:** 
- **Melee:** STR or DEX + Skill + d10 vs. target's Defense
- **Ranged:** DEX + Skill + d10 vs. target's Defense

**4. Defense:**
- **Base Defense:** 10 + DEX modifier
- **Cover/Dodge:** +2 to +5 depending on circumstances

**5. Damage:**
- **Success by 1-5:** Normal damage
- **Success by 6-10:** Double damage
- **Success by 11+:** Triple damage (critical hit)

**6. Damage Resolution:**
- Compare damage to target's CON
- **Under CON:** Minor injury, no mechanical effect
- **Equal to CON:** Moderate injury, -2 to actions
- **Over CON:** Serious injury, -4 to actions, bleeding
- **Double CON:** Critical injury, incapacitated
- **Triple CON:** Fatal injury

## Power Usage

### Activating Powers

**Power Check:** WIL + Power Level + d10 vs. Difficulty

**Standard Difficulties:**
- **Routine (10):** Normal power use
- **Challenging (15):** Pushing limits
- **Heroic (20):** Maximum effort
- **Impossible (25+):** Beyond designed capacity

### Power Levels and Effects

**Level 1:** Enhanced human capability
- Enhanced Strength 1: Lift 500 lbs, punch through drywall
- Enhanced Speed 1: Run 30 mph
- Regeneration 1: Heal minor wounds in hours

**Level 2:** Clearly superhuman
- Enhanced Strength 2: Lift 1 ton, punch through brick
- Enhanced Speed 2: Run 60 mph
- Regeneration 2: Heal moderate wounds in minutes

**Level 3:** Spectacular superhuman
- Enhanced Strength 3: Lift 5 tons, punch through concrete
- Enhanced Speed 3: Run 120 mph
- Regeneration 3: Heal serious wounds in rounds

**Level 4:** Major superhuman
- Enhanced Strength 4: Lift 20 tons, punch through steel
- Enhanced Speed 4: Run 240 mph

**Level 5:** Peak superhuman
- Enhanced Strength 5: Lift 100 tons, punch through reinforced structures
- Enhanced Speed 5: Run 500 mph
- Regeneration 5: Nearly unkillable, regenerate from near-death

### Power Complications

**Critical Failure (Natural 1):** Your power malfunctions
- Flashback to combat conditioning
- Uncontrolled power surge
- Psychological stress (WIL check or temporary complication)

**Collateral Damage:**
Using powers at high levels causes destruction:
- **Level 3+:** Property damage is automatic
- **Level 4+:** Risk to bystanders
- **Level 5:** Catastrophic destruction

**Every point of collateral damage can decrease Safety or Infrastructure by 1.**

### Power Stunts

You can attempt creative uses of your powers with GM approval:

**Examples:**
- Enhanced Strength: Use as a battering ram, throw heavy objects as weapons
- Enhanced Speed: Create sonic booms, run on walls
- Regeneration: Survive otherwise fatal damage, ignore poison
- Stealth Field: Become invisible to cameras, create decoys

**Stunt Difficulty:** Usually +5 to standard power check

## Combat Tactics

### Cover and Positioning

**Full Cover (+5 Defense):** Behind concrete walls, vehicles
**Partial Cover (+3 Defense):** Behind furniture, corners
**Concealment (+1 Defense):** Smoke, darkness, crowds

**High Ground:** +2 to ranged attacks
**Flanking:** +2 to attacks when allies engage same target

### Called Shots

Target specific locations at -4 penalty:

- **Head:** Double damage on hit
- **Weapon Arm:** Disarm on successful hit
- **Legs:** Reduce movement to half
- **Center Mass:** No penalty, standard damage

### Suppressive Fire

Spend entire turn firing to create suppression zone:
- Targets in zone take -4 to all actions
- Anyone entering zone risks getting hit
- Consumes large amounts of ammunition

### Grappling

**Initiate:** STR vs. STR contest
**Success:** Target is grappled (cannot move, -4 to actions)
**Escape:** STR vs. STR contest as standard action
**While Grappling:** Can attempt throws, chokes, or disarms

## Superhuman Combat

### Power vs. Power

When two powered individuals clash:
- Compare power levels + relevant attribute + d10
- Higher result determines outcome
- Ties create dramatic standoffs or mutual damage

### Slushie vs. Baseline Human

**Reality Check:** You are MUCH more powerful than normal humans.
- Most gangers have STR 2-3, no powers
- Rent-A-Cops have DEX 3-4, basic body armor
- Average civilian is helpless against you

**Moral Choice:** How much force is appropriate?
- Non-lethal takedowns (intimidation, restraint)
- Measured force (injury, not death)
- Maximum force (you're a living weapon)

**Reputation Consequences:**
- **Too Gentle:** Gangs don't fear you, attacks continue
- **Balanced:** Respect and fear, reduced violence
- **Too Brutal:** Terror, residents fear you too
