# Social Change Mechanics

## Overview

The **Social Change system** is the core mechanical framework of the Housing Crisis campaign. Your goal isn't just to fight—it's to transform Paradise Heights from a war zone into a thriving community. This system tracks your progress across 20 sessions.

## The Eight Statistics

Paradise Heights is tracked using eight neighborhood statistics, each rated from 0-10:

### 1. Safety (Current: 2)
How secure residents feel. Are streets safe to walk at night? Can children play outside?

**Low Safety:** Gang violence, muggings, random shootings  
**High Safety:** Residents patrol neighborhoods, community watches established

### 2. Employment (Current: 1)
Job availability and economic opportunity for residents.

**Low Employment:** Widespread unemployment, desperation, poverty  
**High Employment:** Local businesses hiring, job training programs, economic activity

### 3. Health (Current: 1)
Access to medical care, clean water, and sanitation.

### 7. Crime (Current: 9) *Lower is Better*
Level of criminal activity beyond gang violence (theft, smuggling, exploitation).

**High Crime:** Rampant theft, black markets, exploitation of vulnerable  
**Low Crime:** Honest community, mutual respect, trust

## Tracking Progress

**The GM maintains a visible stat board showing:**

- Sessions remaining (20 sessions total)
- Recent stat changes

**Players should always know where they stand and what needs improvement.**

## Example Session Flow

**Session 4: "Water Crisis"**

**Starting Stats:** Safety 3, Health 2, Infrastructure 3, Morale 3

**Mission:** Secure clean water supply from corporate reservoir

**Outcomes:**
- Success: Health +2 (secured water), Infrastructure +1 (repaired pipes)
- Complication: Safety -1 (corporate security retaliation)
- Downtime Actions: Community meeting (Morale +1), Repair work (Infrastructure +1)

**End of Session Stats:** Safety 2, Health 4, Infrastructure 5, Morale 4

**QoL Progress:** 15 → 19 (gaining momentum!)

## GM Guidance

**Balancing Challenge:**
- Early campaign (1-7): Focus on immediate crises (Safety, Health)
- Mid campaign (8-14): Build infrastructure and systems
- Late campaign (15-20): Defend against corporate pushback while maintaining gains

**Pacing:**
- Average +2-3 total stat points per session
- Expect occasional setbacks (-1 or -2)
- Players should reach QoL 40+ by session 20 with consistent effort

**Failure States:**
- If QoL drops below 10, Paradise Heights is collapsing
- If any positive stat reaches 0, that creates a crisis arc
- If Safety reaches 0, evacuation becomes necessary

## Tips for Players

1. **Focus on fundamentals first:** Safety, Health, Infrastructure
2. **Morale multiplies effectiveness:** High morale makes other improvements easier
3. **Balance offense and defense:** Don't just attack gangs, build alternatives
4. **Use your powers strategically:** High-profile power use has consequences
5. **Engage residents:** They're not NPCs to save, they're allies to empower
6. **Think long-term:** Quick fixes feel good but systemic change lasts
