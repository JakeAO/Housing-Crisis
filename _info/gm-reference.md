# GM Quick Reference Sheet

## Core Mechanics

### Attribute Checks
**Roll:** Attribute + d10 vs. Target Number

**Difficulty Scale:**
- **Easy (5):** Most people can do this
- **Average (10):** Requires competence
- **Challenging (15):** Difficult even for experts
- **Heroic (20):** Requires exceptional ability
- **Legendary (25+):** Nearly impossible

### Skill Checks
**Roll:** Attribute + Skill + d10 vs. Target Number

### Power Checks
**Roll:** WIL + Power Level + d10 vs. Target Number

**Power Complications:**
- **Natural 1:** Malfunction, flashback, loss of control
- **Fail by 5+:** Power works but with side effects
- **Success:** Power works as intended
- **Success by 10+:** Exceptional effect

## Combat Quick Rules

### Initiative
DEX + d10 (highest goes first)

### Attack Roll
Melee: STR or DEX + Skill + d10 vs. Defense  
Ranged: DEX + Skill + d10 vs. Defense

### Defense
10 + DEX modifier + Armor

### Damage
- **Beat Defense by 1-5:** Normal damage
- **Beat Defense by 6-10:** Double damage
- **Beat Defense by 11+:** Triple damage (crit)

### Damage Resolution
Compare damage to target's CON:
- **Under CON:** Minor injury, no penalty
- **Equal CON:** Moderate injury, -2 to actions
- **Over CON:** Serious injury, -4 to actions
- **Double CON:** Critical injury, incapacitated
- **Triple CON:** Fatal injury

## Social Change Mechanics

### Current Stats (Session 1)
- Safety: 2
- Employment: 1
- Health: 1
- Infrastructure: 2
- Education: 1
- Morale: 2
- Crime: 9
- Corruption: 8

**Starting QoL:** 12 out of 60

### Improvement Guidelines

**Easy Improvements (+1):**
- Complete simple mission successfully
- Establish minor service
- Clear small threat
- Acquire needed resources

**Moderate Improvements (+2):**
- Complete major mission
- Establish significant service (clinic, school)
- Defeat major gang threat
- Secure vital resource (water, power)

**Major Improvements (+3):**

- Defeat major antagonist
- Establish revolutionary system
- Rare, earned through exceptional play

### Degradation Triggers

Stats decrease when:
- Mission fails catastrophically
- Resource is lost or destroyed
- Major setback occurs
- Stat dependencies fail (Health needs water)

**Typical Degradation:** -1 per trigger

### Collateral Damage

Track visible destruction:
- Property damage → Infrastructure -1
- Civilian casualties → Safety -1, Morale -1
- Excessive force → Safety -1
- High-profile incidents → Multiple stats affected

## Tone Reminders

**Satirical Dystopia:**
- Exaggerate corporate absurdity
- Dark humor about systemic failures
- Crass product placement (Tastee-Goo!)
- Media lies are obvious

**Hopeful Resistance:**
- Small victories matter
- Community building is heroic
- Every stat point earned is meaningful
- PCs can make a difference

**Moral Weight:**
- Collateral damage has consequences
- Power without responsibility is tyranny
- Civilians are people, not statistics
- How you win matters

## GM Principles

1. **Make Social Change Visible:** Show stat improvements affecting residents
2. **Honor Player Choices:** Actions have consequences, good and bad
3. **Balance Power Fantasy and Challenge:** PCs are strong but not invincible
4. **Humanize NPCs:** Even gangers have motivations
5. **Track Collateral Damage:** Violence has costs
6. **Respect the Setting:** Satire has bite, but hope is real
7. **Keep Moving Forward:** 20 sessions is your target
8. **Make Paradise Heights Real:** Names, faces, stories matter

## Emergency GM Moves

**Players Stuck:**
- NPC offers information or help
- Complication forces action
- Time pressure increases

**Combat Too Easy:**
- Reinforcements arrive
- Complications (hostages, collateral damage)
- Environmental hazards

**Combat Too Hard:**
- Escape route appears
- Ally arrives
- Enemy makes tactical error

**Social Change Stalling:**
- New opportunity for improvement
- Resident requests specific help
- Resource becomes available

**Players Going Off-Track:**
- Corporate pressure brings them back
- Residents need help now
- Gang activity escalates

## Key NPCs One-Line Reminders

- **Maria Santos:** The heart, single mother, believes in community
- **Old Sam:** The cynic, wants to believe, tactical advice
- **Dr. Tanaka:** The healer, ethical compass, haunted by failures
- **King Jay (Red Kings):** The rival, protector through crime, complex
- **Chrome Chen (Disciples):** The pragmatist, tech thief, business not violence
- **Captain Webb:** The bully, corrupt cop, easy to hate
- **Amanda Frost:** The investigator, corporate loyalty, frighteningly competent
- **Director Pierce:** The system, never seen, represents corporate power

## Victory Conditions (Session 20)

**Minimum Victory (QoL 40):**
- All positive stats at 5+
- All negative stats at 4 or lower
- Paradise Heights is self-sustaining

**Major Victory (QoL 50):**
- All positive stats at 7+
- All negative stats at 2 or lower
- Paradise Heights is thriving

**Perfect Victory (QoL 60):**
- All positive stats at 10
- All negative stats at 0
- Paradise Heights is utopia (by dystopian standards)

## Failure States

**If QoL drops below 10:**
- Paradise Heights is collapsing
- Crisis arc required

**If any positive stat reaches 0:**
- That creates immediate emergency
- Must be addressed next session

**If Safety reaches 0:**
- Residents evacuating
- Neighborhood is war zone
