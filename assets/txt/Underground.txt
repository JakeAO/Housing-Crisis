Paraguay: A resource conflict engulfed the central region of the South American continent in 2016. By the time the conflict had run its course, participating major militant corporations included Allied Mayhem Inc., Trans-World Conflicts Inc., and Disposable Heroes Inc. Client staves included the USA, China, and Neo-Deutschland. Estro-GinTM: A popular alcoholic beverage that i s unusually tasty and addictive due to the fact that it is laced with human hormones.

GCS DW 770/g: A high-performance assault firearm manufactured by the Glint of Cold Steel Corporation and ideally

LIFE-POD CRASH-LANDS O N EARTH

In August of 1996, a life-pod launched from an interstellar starship crashlanded in the Florida Everglades, killing the pair of lobster-like aliens it was

After a lengthy examination, government-sponsored researchers assembled a detailed profile of the aliens, whom they found to be totally unlike any creature mankind had ever imagined. The aliens' technology was found to be based entirely around the manipulation of

At first, the American government tried to cover up the arrival of the aliens. But the descending life-pod attracted a lot of attention in South Florida, filling the popular press with the accounts of eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen either the pod, the government teams sent to investigate, or both. Before long, the existence of STLs "Alpha" and "Beta" (the official government designations for the dead aliens) became the worst kept secret in the world intelligence community. By January of 1997, American diplomats were already confirming the existence of the spacecraft off-the-record and beginning to make overtures to the world community about drafting a plan to deal with the visitation and all its consequences. Shortly thereafter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began to suspect that one of the private researchers who examined the spacecraft was using technological insights gleaned from the pod to help Niagara Entertainment Inc. manufacture a revolutionary line of consumer products. Because the "secret" of the

the mere existence of the spacecraft, government officials finally decided to reveal the STLs to the world-at-large. First, information proving the pod existed, crash-landed in Florida, and was recovered by the Air Force was leaked to the major media. Two days later, the leak was followed by an official confirmation.

Shortly after the STLs became a major media event, American officials cooperated with the United Nations Security Council to establish an international committee in charge of disseminating the data uncovered by the American researchers who examined the pod. Although US officials wanted the data to remain secret, the outcry from the international community was quickly rising to a defeaning roar. In light of the rumors surrounding N i a g a r a Entertainment's new product line, America's rivals in Europe and the Far East feared that secrets gleaned from the pod might provide the Americans with an insurmountable edge in the "trade war'' that had gripped the world since the early 1990s. To assuage these fears and reduce political tensions, American officials agreed to share the alien data, though a small amount of alien information was secretly withheld from the UN committee. Although the American ploy was partially successful in deflating global tension, a few members of the world intelligence community noticed enough inconsistencies to suspect the Americans of holding back information, touching off The

large portions of the planet, and multi-national corporations grew larger and more powerful than ever before. Shortly after the turn of the century, warfare evolved into a business as multi-national corporations organized large, technologically sophisticated armies capable of rapid deployment to any hot spot on the planet. These corporations offered their services to the highest bidder, making the use of military force as an arm of policy more attractive to the world's governments. The most sawy world leaders quickly realized that the militant corporations neatly eliminated most of the drawbacks that prevented their governments from widespread use of force in the past. Under

this new system, nations need no longer wager their own resources to declare war. They simply cut a check and allow a subcontractor to assume all the risks. Furthermore, because a direct and sudden threat to any of the three trading blocks that have dominated world commerce for more than thirty years would sharply injure the economies of the others, no major nation need fear a direct reprisal from another world power. Only a few years after the first corporate army took to the battlefield, all three of the major trading blocks were routinely hiring corporate soldiers to intervene in scores of Third World squabbles and conflicts in the hope of protecting and expanding their economic interests. Typically, the most significant of these conflicts quickly grew into miniature and impersonal "world wars'' in which all the major nations of the world participated through hired agents and armies.

AMI scientists learned to modify human genetic tissues, turning test subjects
into "super-men" capable of dominating a modern battlefield. The only problem encountered by the scientists was the fact that stabilizing the genetic enhancement process required a living subject with a seriously impaired capacity to replace lost body cells. AMI solved this problem by acquiring Cryc-DawnTMInc. and its stable of "clients." In 1999, after a rash of investigative reporting in the maior media revealed that Cryo-Dawn's freezing process left its patrons brain-dead, the cryo-freeze fad soured, tumbling the firm into bankruptcy. Consequently, once AMI scientists discovered that cryofreeze deadened the body's ability to replace lost cells, it was a simple matter for AMI to acquire Cryo-Dawn's assets, including more than 250 frozen

AMI REMAINS ON TOP IN THE GENETIC ARMS RACE.

Although the first genetically enhanced soldiers had an immediate and significant impact on the battlefield, they weren't the maior military breakthrough that AMI and the US Government were hoping for. Due to their primitive artificial brains, the enhanced soldiers were easy to outsmart and frequently failed to follow

backs, the new breed of soldiers sparked a panic among AMI'Srivals, all of whom scrambled to develop genetic enhancement programs of their own. By

2009, most of the world's major militant corporations were employing primitive enhanced cyborgs, touching off a sort of "genetic arms race.'' Of course, the leg up they received from the alien information withheld by the American government kept Allied Mayhem perched at the forefront of genetic enhancement technology for the next decade.

PSYCHOLOGICAL INSTABILITY IS AN OBSTACLE TO THE ENHANCEMENT

By 2013, genetic scientists all across the world were already close to pioneering an enhancement process usable on living human beings. And in

2014, Allied Mayhem began enhancing live volunteers in limited numbers. Although this latest generation of enhanced soldiers was very effective in battle, the new process was ultimately deemed unstable and abandoned. During the many months that AMI scientists spent conquering the cellular regeneration problem, they failed to recognize psychological instability as an even more profound obstacle to the enhancement of live subjects. The first such subjects who awoke to discover that they were suddenly capable of lifting cars, flying, and projecting powerful force fields all lost their grip on reality and went mad. AMI researchers ultimately discovered that such a radical shift in world view was simply too much for a conscious human mind to handle. Although most of the enhanced soldiers served admirably at first, they later became unpredictable and psychotic. Some simply became catatonic and refused to believe their newly acquired abilities truly functioned. Others went on homicidal and unstoppable rampages.

SUBJECTS.

The psychological problem was solved a year later, when Dr. Rudolph Bushmiller happened to notice one of his young nephews reading a copy of

the ruorld of 2021
Freedom league Quarterly. Once he saw the Freedom League in action, the connection between the "super-heroes" of pop myth and the enhanced soldiers AMI was trying to create became obvious to Dr. Bushmiller, providing

him with the clues he needed to conquer psychological burnout. Bushmiller's solution was to create a sort of "virtual reality" simulation of the Freedom

DESCRIPTION Ob THE BUSHMILLER PROCESS

these fourteen months, the computer's program enables the subject to relive

his or her entire life as it might have occurred in the fourcolor world of the
Freedom League. At some point during the simulation, the subject's persona blueprint acquires the enhanced abilities the AMI scientists are simultaneously installing in his or her physical body. The Freedom League setting, Bushmiller discovered, was simple enough to be effectively simulated by a computer and ''unreal'' enough to allow the subject to understand and accept the enhancements. Once the process is complete and the subject is removed from sensory deprivation, AMI psychologically reconditions the subject to rejoin the real world, though a psychological acceptance of his or her newly acquired abilities lingers on within the individual's subconscious mind alongside a faint memory of his or her virtual life.

Although i t is certainly effective, the Bushmiller Process i s not without its drawbacks. First, although the Slumberland simulation relieves most of the psychological stress of enhancement, few subjects remain completely free of stress symptoms. Although the latest breed of enhanced soldiers are not the catatonic invalids and psychotic killers produced during the earliest experiments with live enhancement, most are neurotic, slightly detached from reality, and prone to extreme mood swings. More importantly, there is a sort of "land mine" hidden within the Slumberland simulation that Bushmiller's successors are still trying to understand. Somehow, the "black-and-white" moral-

ity of the average Freedom Leaguer instantly ingrains itself into the subconscious minds of many of the subjects who undergo enhancement. Those who are most severely affected by this strange side effect adopt a "comic book" world view and begin to interpret life as a series of struggles between "heroes" and "villains." Given the growing alienation of the lower classes and the current climate of predatory corporate practices, a few such subjects

In order to hide valuable trade secrets from the prying eyes of its enemies, the United States has been forced to monitor the activities of its citizens more closely, adding new levels of bureaucracy to the federal government. Furthermore, the scores of government agencies and bureaus established to help monitor the citizenry have made a great deal of "personal" information about millions of Americans available to politicians willing to use such information unscrupulously.

THE DEMAND FOR RECRUITS

Although modern armies are made up of far fewer soldiers than their 20th century counterparts due to the supremacy of the genetically-enhanced soldier, the frequency of international conflict demands a large number of recruits. By 202 1, most American citizens know one or two youngsters serving with militant corporations; and in some economically depressed communities, a lack of alternative opportunities is driving entire generations off to war. Despite the fact that the American government i s fighting its wars by proxy, the majority of the soldiers employed by conflict firms hired by the United States are American.

To comply with the act, the Department of Housing and Urban Development built a number of high-rise housing projects on government-owned land in California's major cities.

find lobs upon their return to the U.S. Poverty coupled with the psychological stress of genetic enhancement leads many veterans into a life of crime, filling the streets of many major population centers with genetically enhanced hoodlums who are trained for combat. To make matters worse, some major cities are forced to devote much of their resources to curbing crime among the veterans, allowing traditional criminals more freedom to operate. These problems are particularly acute on the west coast, where US government programs provide low-cost housing for veterans. The frequent wars in the Third World have greatly complicated U.S.

Usually, there are so many wars and political conflicts in progress at any one time that most Americans can't possibly digest enough information from the news media to understand them all. This lack of comprehension has led many Americans to feel "disconnected" from their government, their nation, and the world. Over the last decade, many traditional sources of news and information have become defunct as more and more Americans lost interest in them. Furthermore, many Americans find it so difficult to distinguish one political philosophy from another that most public elections are greeted with apathy.

In 2021, world politics are dominated by three large trading blocks: the North American Confederation, consisting of the United States, Mexico, and Central America; the Far East Collective, made up of China, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Japan; and the European Common Market, made up of all the nations in Western Europe but dominated by Neo-Deutschland. Long ago, these three organizations learned to develop and exploit their own resources and markets to their fullest potential. Thus, the only way the trading blocks can continue to increase their market shares and remain competitive is to gain access to new resources and new markets in nations that lie outside the blocks in the so-called "Third World."

Ever since the advent of multi-national conflict firms, the most effective means
of gaining political dominance over a Third World nation has been the use

of military force. Ideally, one of the large trading blocks identifies a new market it is interested in developing and hires a conflict firm to back opposition to the local government.

Neo-Deutschland was formed when the newly reunited East and West Germanies formed a Constitutional Collective to reform the German government in t h e wake of the 2002 Depression. At present, Neo-Deutschland is a theocratic, semi-dictatorship b u i l t around t h e principles of Scientology. Members of NeoDeutschland's dominant ARC party always hold positions in both the federal government and t h e Church of Scientology. Sitting atop both the government and the church is a triumvirate known a s the Ministers of Having, Being, and Loving. Culturally, Neo-Deutschland has gone a long way toward recapturing t h e creative renaissance of t h e Weimar Republic, though alleged human rights abuses are beginning to drive away intellectuals. In the world community, the Neo-Deutsch are known for their cold efficiency, a trait t h a t h a s elevated Neo-Deutschland to a position of total dominance within t h e European Common Market.

This second block might want the new market for itself, or perhaps it simply doesn't want to lose market share to the original invader.

MODERN
AMERICA IS DOMINATED BY BIG CITIES

Over the last forty to fifty years, the American economy has continued to veer away from agriculture and toward the service sector. As a conse quence, by 202 1, most of the American population is tightly clustered into huge urban centers. Cities with populations in excess of 18,000,000 are not uncommon, contributing to all sorts of social and economic problems.

THE CITIES OF 2021 LOOK NOTHING LIKE THEIR 20TH CENTURY ANCESTORS

On the outside, the cities of the 2 1 st century only barely resemble their 20th century ancestors. Rising real estate prices forced most of America's largest cities to build upward as well as outward, creating vast multi-tiered mazes crossed by huge boulevards that rise and fall between all the city's various levels. Furthermore, the cities of the 2 1 st century are expanding much faster than their predecessors. Because of this expansion and the extraordinary amount of property damage that results from gang wars between boosted hoodlums, new

i s constantly in evidence. Also noticeable is the

relative lack of cars and other vehicles. Due to the growing rift between the upper and middle classes, fewer and fewer Americans can afford cars, forcing urban centers to build larger and more efficient public transportation networks.

MacRaney's: a fast-food hamburger chain founded in

The Pre-Frontals
Over the last 50 years, increasingly sophisticated marketing tactics applied to consumers both inside and outside the United States have made many Americans very wealthy. But one of the basic principles that drives America's capitalist economy i s the axiom of equilibrium

1994. Since 1998, MacRane$s
market share has been so large that the Fat Mac, the chain's double-decker cheeseburger, has become a cultural icon. For the last five years, MacRaney's has used the ad slogan, "Ask yourself ... Who's the Mac?"

- whenever someone

becomes wealthy, someone else becomes poor. Ultimately, this axiom is responsible for a chain of give-ond-take that extends through the various social strata all the way down to the citizens of the very lowest socioeconomic class, a position currently occupied by the so-called "pre-frontals." By

$80,000 brh\ern 1993 and

2017, many of the nation's blue collar agricultural and manufacturing iobs
were taken over by pre-frontals as more and more better-educated Americans left for higher paying lobs in the service sector. Now, in 2021, pre-frontals make up the backbone of America's unskilled workforce.

The pre-frontals themselves are a product of the technological revolution that followed in the wake of the alien visitation. In 2001, after some of the technology gleaned from the alien life-pod had an opportunity to work its way through the major American universities, scientists working for the MacRaney's Corporation were perfecting a series of cloning techniques based around the manipulation of amino acid chains. The scientists were hoping to successfully clone cattle, giving the fast food chain an endless supply of cheap beef. But the first few executives who read the scientists' reports had different ideas. MacRaney's upper management ran spreadsheet programs on the scientists' data and arrived at some startling conclusions. According to the scientists' projections, cloning an organism would cost approximately $80,000 in chemicals and overhead, a figure MacRaney's managers estimated that cloning in bulk could reduce by 25%. At the same time, market research showed that the average American spends roughly

$120,000 on MacRaney's hamburgers across the course of his or her lifetime. After these figures were compared, the executives changed the entire direction of the cloning program and began looking into the possibility of cloning humans instead of cattle. By creating their own future consumers in this fashion, MacRaney's stood to earn a $60,000 profit on each person created across the course of that individual's lifetime.

Tecl oh _- n the World of 2021
The secrets of bio-engineering gleaned from the alien space-pod ushered in a technological revolution t h a t left its mark on every scientific discipline known to man. By 2021, in most fields, new advances have made the unthinkable a n everyday reality.

The computer industry is home to what are perhaps the most stunning innovations of all. By 2021, virtually every device or appliance sold across the entire world has been designed to transmit digital information. This feature enables these items to interface with computers, allowing just about any device in the world to communicate with any other device. The various applications of the new digital network are staggering - consumers can program any device in their homes with detailed instructions or control any device from a distance via digital phone lines; firearms plug into computers worn by soldiers and transmit a n ammunition count and aiming information to heads-up displays contained within the soldiers’ helmets; movies and audio recordings are sold in a digital format, allowing consumers to edit and modify these works to fit their own tastes; etc. On the industrial end of t h e spectrum, mainframe computers are also far superior to their 20th century counterparts. Using technology derived from the alien pod, human brains can be directly connected to computers to provide a n enormously fast and powerful storage media (known as a “bio-drive“). Modern mainframes connected to one or more discarded brains can now efficiently store and access thousands of gigabytes of information. allowing for more sophisticated applications of computer technology.

I n 2021, t h e most fearsome weapon battlefield soldiers are likely to encounter is Paste,TM an adhesive jelly that dissolves organic compounds, reducing living targets to puddles of genetic slop.

Because fewer citizens can now afford automobiles, transportation in the 21st century is dominated by mass transit systems. Most major cities are criss-crossed with subway and elevated lines providing convenient access to all neighborhoods, while large cities on all continents are connected by high-speed rail terminals (250 MPH and up). Most of the delays associated with 20th century mass transit have been eliminated by running a larger number of smaller “trains” (seating 3-5 passengers) on each line. Automobiles may be expensive, but they have not disappeared completely. At present, several US manufacturers are battling with Iraqi and Chinese firms for control of the world automotive market. Modern autos provide a whole range of services unavailable in their 20th century ancestors due to the fact that the autos accept digital input, allowing them to interact with a vast array of consumer devices and appliances.

Doctors can now control the rate a t which living tissues reproduce, eliminating the threat of cancer and most viruses, and accelerating the rate a t which the body heals wounds and injuries. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic engineering techniques allow couples to select the physical and personality characteristics exhibited by their offspring. Of course, the mere fact t h a t these medical technologies exist does not mean they are widely available to the general public. In fact, all of these specialized techniques are extremely costly, making them available to only a small portion of the world’s population. Of more general interest to the common citizen is the widespread availability of artificial brains. These organs don’t allow for the sophisticated reasoning possible with a real brain, but they can be programmed to keep their users happy and productive. In fact, more and more members of the lower class are buying artificial brains and selling their biological brains to the computer industry for use in bio-drives.

the Hartley-Simmons Act, requiring firms interested in creating clones to obtain special federal licenses and pay heavy duties. But by that time, the clones were beginning to mate with each other, greatly increasing their numbers. According to the February 2021 census, more than 40,000,000 clones currently inhabit the United States.

PRE-FRONTALS ARE IMPERFECT DUPLICATES OF HUMANITY

The prefrontals acquired their name from certain deficiencies that manifest themselves in the frontal lobes of the clones' brains as they are created. These deficiencies leave the clones incapable of agile or creative thought. In manner, they exhibit many of the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia they move and speak slowly, they find it difficult to focus their attention, and they sometimes find it impossible to separate fantasy from reality. Another flaw exhibited by the prefrontals can be found in their genetic makeup. For some reason, the clones possess only 45 chromosomes, making it impossible for them to mate with anyone other than themselves. Whether or not there is a connection between these two deficiencies remains unknown.

prejudice: On the streets, "cromag" (or simply "cro") i\ a common derogatory epithet used to describe the prefrontals.

PRE-FRONTALS

Because they are slow-witted and willing to work for sub-par wages, p r e frontals are the victims of a great deal of prejudice from the American public. For this reason, they tend to live in exclusively prefrontal ghettos found in the industrial districts of most maior American cities. Due to their limited intellectual capacity, they rarely venture out of these areas, preferring instead to spend their recreational time watching the vid-net and eating fast food.

Recently, the prefrontals have become embroiled in a new controversy. A group of liberal scientists claims to have discovered evidence indicating that MacRaney's technicians altered the pre-frontals' RNA patterns as they were created, genetically pre-disposing the clones to acquire a taste for MacRaney's hamburgers. Despite the fact that legal scholars can't even agree as to whether or not predisposing the clones would constitute a crime, MacRaney's officials are denying the allegations.

Entertainment in 2021

I

Entertainment in 2021 is distinguished from its 20th century counterpart by the healthy doses of sex and violence it invariably contains. Over the last fifty years, the art of storytelling has waned in favor of increasingly sophisticated sensory titilation made possible by futuristic sound and video technology. Many modern programs are nothing but sloppily edited collections of hardcore battle or sex scenes. Although the programming may have changed, for all practical purposes, the media remain the same. Movies are still popular, as are albums of recorded music (now sold almost exclusively on optical disks). Television, too, is still around, although the service has been known as “vid-net” ever since most of the world’s broadcasters joined together to form a 4,000 channel digital cable system in 2014. Specially tailoring works to individual artificial brain models is the latest trend to sweep the entertainment industry. Top entertainment firms are now paying brain manufacturers exorbitant sums in return for the technical specifications of their models, allowing the entertainment executives to guarantee t h a t their releases will be enjoyed by a certain segment of the public.

The fad h a s roots stretching all the way back to Millie's, a chic cannibal restaurant founded in 1997 in New York's Greenwich Village underground. Eventually, Millie's became so popular t h a t the practice was legalized, allowing cannibal restaurants to spread across America. By 2011, a pair of competing cannibal fast food chains, Tastee Ghoul and Sweeney's, opened thousands of outlets from coast-to-coast.
Contrary to the rumors invented by grade school children, the people who become Tastee Ghoul and Sweeney's products are not murdered in the night by teams of shadowy assassins. In 2010, Congress passed a bill, the MacMurtry Foodstuffs Act, t h a t placed a c a r e fully-worded legal document on the back of every driver's license issued in t h e USA.

At first, the radicals succeeded only in giving the police broad new powers and increasing the severity of criminal sentencing. But by 2010, the conservatives were already arguing that the growing crime epidemic was a sign of America's "weakness," prompting the Congress to create elite bureaus to monitor the American citizenry and to authorize a new wave of covert operations abroad.

Politics
On the local, state, and national level, American politics are dominated by three major political parties.

[HE PLUTOCRATIC PARTY DEFENDS AMERICAN BUSINESS

The Plutocratic Party: The Plutocrats first banded together as a political
party in 2002, though the roots of the organization extend all the way back to Ross Perot's presidential campaign of 1992. At the core of the Plutocratic philosophy i s the notion that America's security rests upon its economic superiority. The Plutocrats believe that every issue should be resolved in the manner most beneficial to big business and thus most beneficial to American interests.

atlni

In 202 1, the Plutocrats control approximately 40% of the House of Representatives and 43% of the Senate. The current President of the United States, Charles Foster, and his administration are Plutocrats.

THE OLD DEMOCR4TS .4ND REPUBLICANS COMBINED TO FORM THE REPURLOCRATIC PARR

The Republocratic Party: After the Plutocrats rose to power in the earliest part of the 2 1 st century, the old Democratic and Republican parties joined forces to provide an effective political opposition. Although the Republocratic party nominally professes to safeguard traditional American political values as its highest priority, the sharp differences between the old Democrats and Republicans make it difficult to fathom the party's exact age&.
nr-

Mmt observers believe the Republocrats "see how the Plutocrats \m+n +-Lo +k opposite stance, and reap the benefits of
mise."

Although the Republocrats control a smaller percentage of Congress than their Plutocratic rivals (38% in the House, 40% in the Senate), they are beginning to experience a noticeable surge in popularity, thanks in part to

At the core of the Atomic Kennedy's encephalic circuitry is an actual brain fragment taken from assassinated president John

bid, he has achieved a whole new level of popular acceptance

as the symbolic head of the Kennedy Youth and star of Camelot: The Next

Generation, the highest rated vid-net drama on the airwaves.

ation

The National Anti-Socialist Party: In 201 8, the most radically conservative elements of the Plutocratic and Republocratic parties came together to form their own party, the National Anti-Socialists (NAS).NAS members have adopted the suppression of sedition and the elimination of "threatening e l e ments" within the society as the cornerstone of their political agenda. In practice, this means that most of the policies advocated by the National AntiSocialists are tainted by paranoia, bigotry, and hypocrisy.

THE LAW HAS CHANGED A GREAT DEAL IN 50 YEARS

srparatc nation\ Corporations that secure thcir independence

The political turmoil brought about by the Second Cold War and America's changing role in the new world order has given rise to one of the most volatile eras in American legal history. Over the last twenty five years, the United States Constitution has been amended seven separate times. These new amendments have wrought three important changes upon American society.

CORPORATIONS

First, properly registered corporations now have the right to negotiate and interact with foreign powers as though they are separate nations, provided such interaction does not break the laws of the United States within the territory of the United States (the Twenty-Seventh Amendment). It was this important piece of legislation that cleared the way for the foundation of militant corporations and private armies. Furthermore, a combination of the TwentyEighth Amendment and a legislative package passed in 2016 provides a mechanism whereby corporate entities can purchase complete sovereignty and declare themselves separate nations located inside the United States. Corporations that exercise such an option gain immunity from American laws on their own properties. In return, federal, state, and local governments gain huge sovereignty fees plus fees for licensing the sovereign American civil services. Such fees almost always vastly exceed the taxes paid by the corporations while they were still part of the United States. The few corporations that could afford to gain independence in this fashion have used their new-found freedom to disregard a wide range of criminal and civil statutes on their premises.

enfranchised from their government, a myriad of organizations looking to take government into their own hands arose. At first, most of these groups were little more than small bands of political activists who held periodic rallies aimed at promoting a specific "cause1' or agenda. But over the years, many of the groups metamorphosed into armed and dangerous terrorist organizations. This process was spurred along by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that followed in the wake of the Twenty-Seventh and Twenty-Ninth Amendments and classified a few varieties of violent terrorism as ed

Before long, the rights afforded to the legal terrorist groups emboldened even the illegal groups, setting off a wave of violent terrorist attacks that continues to rock the United States to this day. Hardly a day passes in most major American metropolises without a terrorist bombing, poisoning, or shooting.

The largest and most active terrorist organization in 202 1 America is the socalled "Underground," founded by boosted veterans looking to overthrow the United States government. Details on the Underground and other prominent terrorist organizations can be found in Chapter Eleven.

An interesting backlash to the ever-worsening social conditions in the United States is the so-called "primitivist" movement founded in 201 4. The primi-

Chapters Four and Five to create a boosted veteran from the year 2021. As you make up your characters, you'll decide what they look like, what they act like, what activities they are particularly good or bad at, and how their genetic enhancements have affected them. Because it can take a while to invent these characters, you might want to instruct the players to create them before you're actually ready to play.

A CHARACTER

what is a role playing game?
The player who

did not create a character becomes the Gamemaster, or ref-

THE GM ACTS AS A
REFEREE AND STORY GUIDE

eree. This player has a number of special responsibilities that are not shared by the other players. He or she: creates the basic framework of the story, begins the story, resolves any actions performed by the characters created by the other players, makes decisions for characters not controlled by the other players, and interprets the rules. Usually, it's a good idea to select the player most familiar with the game to take on the role of Gamemaster.

On her own, before the players get together, the Gamemaster secretly
creates the basic outline of a story. For example, if the characters created by the players are all police officers, the GM might create a story c like this:

BEFORE PLAY, THE

GM CREATES A
STORY OUTLINE

A terrorist group has hired six separate street gangs to steal the parts necessary to construct an atomic warhead. The terrorists hope to use the warhead
to destroy the city o f [os Angeles to protest the immoral content of

Hollywood motion pictures.

The Gamemaster also takes some time to figure out:

OHOW the players' characters become involved in the story.
Perhaps the story begins with the players' characters arresting and interrogating a member of one of the hired street gangs who spills the beans about

a big job his gang is pulling.

*Who the players' characters might meet during the story and what these characters are like. In this case, the terrorists, street
gang members, and various motion picture executives. The GM also invents a few details about each of these people (the terrorist leader is a middleaged woman who walks with a limp and hates veterans, etc).

*Where the players' characters might travel during the story and what these places are like. In this case, the headquarters
of the terrorist group and gangs, one or two of the terrorist group's front locations, and a couple of Hollywood studios. The GM also invents a few details about each of these places (the terrorists use the wine cellar of a restaurant owned by the terrorist leader as their headquarters, etc).

*And what might happen during the story. A path of clues
leads the characters from the street gangs to Hollywood to the terrorists. If

the players cannot work their way down this path in four days, the terrorists successfully detonate their bomb.

EVENTUALLY, YOUR OUTLINES WILL GROW

Although the first few story outlines you create will be simple, like the story of the terrorists and street gangs, with time, you'll find your outlines growing more and more interesting. Veteran Gamemasters frequently create story outlines as lengthy and intricate as a good movie or short novel. For a complete example of a fully detailed story outline, see Chapter Nineteen.

Once the outline has been prepared and the players have created their characters, the Gamemaster begins the story.

Can the AMI scientist tap into the IRS computers? What happens when the terrorist takes a shot at the President? The rules help the GM answer these questions.

Seven basic ideas form the foundation of Underground:

Idea #1 - Automatic Actions
THE RULE OF
AUTOMATIC ACTIONS

inclucle: shooting a target,

pcrforming surgen, avoiding an
obstaclc \vhilc driving a car, etc.

The first and simplest idea to grasp is the Rule of Automatic Actions: whenever you want your character (or the GM wants one of the characters she controls) to perform an action that an average human being could perform with virtually no chance of failure, the action i s automatically successful and immediately becomes part of the story. Examples of such actions include: walking across a room to look out a window, speaking, picking up an object, etc. In addition, certain k allow characters possessing them to

perform special Automatic Actions that are unique to those Abilities.

Gamemaster‘s fiat. Because her responsibilities include keeping the story in motion and sorting out any conflicts that arise, the Gamemaster has the abili-

ty to prevent or prohibit an action at any time. Usually, the GM uses this
power to sort out conflicts, but she might occasionally use it to prevent characters from performing the impossible or simply to keep the story interesting.

Idea #2 - Attributes
Every imaginary character and object in the stories you’ll create has certain defining characteristics known as Attributes. Characters have seven Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Speed, Resilience, Intellect, Willpower, and Aura.
EVERY IM4GINARY

CHARACTER AND
OBJECT HAS ONE

ATTRIBUTES

Strength (STR): is a measure of the character's physical power. It
represents his or her abilities to: lift and carry heavy obiects, smash down doors and other barriers, inflict damage in hand-to-hand combat, and exert him or herself over long periods of time.

Resilience (RES): is an indication of the amount of injury the character can sustain before becoming incapacitated. Characters with a particularly high Resilience are less susceptible to diseases and poisons as well as more traditional injuries.

In the world of 2021, a few boosted characters have such high Resiliences that their skin can easily shrug off gunfire.

Intellect (INT): measures the character's intelligence and alertness. Note that Intellect has nothing to do with education. There are many high school dropouts w h o have never read a single Shakespeare play, yet still excel at Intellect. Likewise, there are many PhDs with poor Intellects. INT measures only the character's ability to think quickly and clearly.

Abilities are split into two categories: Skills and Enhancements.

Skills (li

Skills are described Chapter Six. Enhancements are described in Chapter Seven. Players det mine the Abilities possessed by their characters by using the character c ation rules found in Chapter Five. The GM is free to assign any Abilities s Finds appropriate to the characters under her control.

TYPES OF
ABILITIES: SKILLS AND ENHANCEMENTS

rc
As previously mentioned, some Abilities give their owners the ability to perform certain special Automatic Actions. These actions are fully described in Chapters Six and Seven.
Units: is often abbreviated "U." In other words, "7U" means "7 Units.''

Idea #4 - Units
Any action that i s not an Automatic Action ultimately reduces down to a "contest" involving Attributes and/or Abilities. For example, a character who wants to smash down a locked door must use her Strength to overcome the door's Resilience. To resolve such contests we obviously need a method for rating and comparing Attributes and Abilities.

ATTRIBUTES AND ABILITIES ARE MEASURED IN UNITS

In Underground, all Attributes and Abilities are measured in quantities known as Units. By definition, a completely average man possesses nits

in each of his Attributes and Abilities. Furthermore, also by definition, every

3 Units added to an Attribute or Ability doubles the effectiveness of that
Attribute or Ability. Therefore, a man with a STR of 3 is twice as strong as a man with a STR of 0, and a man with a STR of 6 is twice as strong as a man with a STR of 3 (and thus four times as strong as a man with a STR of 0), and so on.

UNIT MEASUREMENTS CAN BE TRANSLATED

Since Unit ratings mean nothing by themselves, we've also converted several ''real world'' measurements into Units, allowing you to translate between Units and more familiar measurement systems with little effort. Using the Unit Benchmark Table on the next page, you can now measure weight, distance, time, volume, and information in Units. And since Units are designed to be interchangeable, you can easily convert back and forth between an Attribute or Ability and an appropriate ''real world'' value. For instance, a character with a STR of 6 can lift 6 Units of weight, or 400

measurements can run infinitely small. The radius of an atom is approximately

Ibs. weighs 4 Units. Thus, when

using the Unit Benchmark Table to make such a conversion, look down the appropriate column of the chart until you find the first number that is greater than or equal to the value you are converting, then look to the leftmost column for its Unit equivalent.

Example: What is the Unit equivalent of 14 minutes? Looking
down the Time column of the Unit Benchmark Chart, we find that 15 minutes is the first listed value that is greater than or equal to the value we are converting, so 14 minutes translates into 24 Units.

2. Note that it is impossible to add two Unit values together, like
you might add together ''real world" values. A small car weighs 15 units (1 1/2). Two small cars stacked together weigh 3 tons, or 18 Units-not

30 Units. When adding Unit values together, first convert

them to a real world value, then add the real world values together, and then convert back to Units.

Example: If Character 1 has a STR of 5 Units and Character 2

lift if they cooperate? With his STR of 5, Character 1 can lift 300 Ibs, and with a STR of 1 1, Character 2 can lift 1200 Ibs. Together, they can lift 1500 Ibs., or 12 Units.

Contests involving Attributes and Abilities are known as Challenges. A character attempting to break down a door is a good example of a Challenge. In this case, the character must pit her STR against the door’s RES.

Resolving Challenges
For a moment, think of Challenges as school courses. There are two types of Challenges, Pass/Fail Challenges and Standard Challenges. A Pass/Fail

(P/F) Challenge is a test in which the character either succeeds or fails. A
Standard Challenge is a test in which knowing whether or not the character succeeds is not enough, you must also know the quality of the character’s success. Attempts to jump over a fence, break down a door, or spot a

hid-

den object are all P/F Challenges; you either succeed at these tasks or you fail. Attempts to punch another character, scan a crime scene for clues, or repair an engine are all Standard Challenges. In each of these tests, varying degrees of success are possible.

RESOLVING P/F

To resolve a P/F Challenge, the player controlling the character per-

forming the action rolls 2D10 and adds their results together. If this original roll resulted in "doubles" (ie. the same value on each die), the player may roll again and add it to the original result. In fact, the player may keep rolling the dice and adding the result to his original total as long as the rolls keep resulting in doubles. For instance: a character rolls a

6 and a 6, rolls again and receives a 7 and 7, and rolls again and
receives a 9 and a 2, for a total roll of 47 (1 O+ 12+ 14+1 1). The player then adds his total dice roll to the Attribute or Ability being Challenged.

Next, the Gamemaster repeats exactly the same process. If the player's total i s greater than the GM's total, the player succeeds. If not, the player fails.

Sample P/F Challenge:

Difficulty: Don't worry if you don't recognix this term. You'll be introduced to the concept of Difficulty in the next few paragraphs.

Standard Challenges are resolved much like P/F Challenges. But in the case of a Standard Challenve, if the Challenge is successful, the players calculate the exact difference between the player's total and the Gamemaster's total and consult the Challenge Chart below.

RESOLVING STANDARD CHALLENGES

Notice how the Challenge Chart gives you a letter grade, similar to tt grades you earned in school, describing how successfully your charact1 overcame the Challenge. Later, you'll learn exactly what these letter grad, mean and how to interpret them.

Using the Difficulty Chart
When using the Difficulty Chart, the Gamemaster should look at the Challenge from the point of view of an average human being like herself. Is the Challenge simple? Average? Very difficult? For assistance, the GM can also look to the chart's "approximate odds" column, which lists the odds of an a\ ige successfully meeting a Challenge at the various listed dif-

ficulty levels. Once the GM has arrived at an appropriate description of the Challenge or the approximate odds of success, she can simply consult the chart's rightmost column to arrive at a Difficultv

The Difficulty Chart has another important function. Sometimes there will be
special circumstances that make a normal A t t r i b u t e / A b i l i t y vs. Attribute/Ability Challenge more difficult than usual. For example, punching a character in hand-to-hand combat is usually a DEX (of the puncher) vs. DEX (of the punchee) Challenge. But suppose the puncher i s intoxicated. Shouldn't it be harder for him to hit the punchee?

it is appropriate. Basically, any action that is not an Automatic Action is a
Challenge.

SOMEIMES THE GM MUST DECIDE WHAT ATTRIBUTES AND ABILITIES TO USE WHEN RESOLVING CHALLENGES

Throughout this rulebook you'll find all sorts of rules for resolving specific Challenge situations that will arise during play. But the rules can't possibly anticipate every single action a character in a story might try to perform. When someone attempts an action that i s not covered by the rules, the

GM

must use her best judgement to determine which Attributes or Abilities are being tested. This i s actually much easier than it zounds, and with time, most

GMs find that this task becomes second nature.

Challenge Examples
Here are a few a sample Challenges to test each of the seven basic Attributes.

STR Breaking down a door, bending or breaking an item, arm wrestling another character.
DEX Jumping over a fence, catching a n object tossed by another character during a fight, playing a video game.

SPD: Diving under a security door a t the end of a long hall before it can close.

RES: Resisting the effects of tear gas, holding you breath long enough to pull a passenger out of a submerged
car wreck.

Idea #6 - Karma Points
Challenges aren't always resolved by the dice alone. Some characters are simply luckier or more confident than others. In Underground, this ability is represented by the use of Karma Points. Characters created by the players begin the game with one Karma Point. The GM is free to assign as many Karma Points to any characters under her control as she wishes.

After any Challenge has been resolved, the character taking the Challenge has the power to spend a Karma Point to convert a failure into a success (in a P/F Challenge) or to improve his letter grade by one step (in a Standard Challenge). Likewise, any character resisting the Challenge has the right to spend a Karma point to turn a success into a failure or to lower the letter grade by one step.

KARMA POINTS
ALLOW CHARACTERS TO ALTER THE OUTCOME OF CHALLENGES

If there are two characters involved in the Challenge in this fashion
and one character spends a Karma point, the other character auto matically has an opportunity to spend a Karma point of his own to effectively "cancel out" the first character's expenditure. Note, too, that during a Standard Challenge, a character can spend more than one Karma Point to raise or lower the letter grade by more than one step.

Once a Karma Point i s spent, it i s gone forever. There are two ways of gaining new Karma: 1 ) whenever a character rolls a natural dice total of 24 or greater when resolving a Challenge, he or she receives a Karma Point, and 2) the GM sometimes awards particularly interesting play with a Karma Point. Note that Karma is gained through the first method only if the actual dice total i s 24 or greater, not the total of the dice roll and the Attribute tested. Furthermore, a character can never earn a Karma Point for resisting a Challenge, no matter what he or she rolls (ie. even if he rolls a 35, the "punchee" in our earlier examples can't earn Karma). Guidelines the GM can use for rewarding good play with Karma can be found in Chapter Twelve.

In these situations, the GM can call for Turns. When Turns are in effect, each character gets an opportunity to perform an action and then play passes to the next character. During his or her Turn, a character gets to perform any action he or she could accomplish in approximately 4 seconds (0 Units of time, or one Turn). You'll find more rules for handling Turns in Chapter Nine.

For the first t n thousand years of human history, a successful m ilitary campaign hinged upon the valor of the common footsoldier. But toward the end of the Second World War, an age in which a single bomb could bring death-by-fire to millions, common valor became overshadowed by technology. Now, in 202 l , technology and valor have merged into a frightening new weapon that promises to change the very nature of mankind.

Enhancement and How it Works
ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGY WAS DERIVED FROM THE ALIEN SPACE POD THAT LANDED IN 1996

The keys that unlocked the secrets of genetic enhancement were gleaned from the alien space pod that crash-landed in 1996. The alien techniques for manipulating amino acids were first applied to the human genotype in

2002, allowing doctors to eradicate certain congenital diseases and genetic
irregularities. The earliest true "enhancements" of the genotype were engineered in 2007, after the American government turned the aliens' last few secrets over to Allied Mayhem Inc.

SURGEONS ALTER GENES BY TRANSFORMING NUCLEOTIDES

Although genetic manipulation is very complex in practice, it's quite simple in theory. By applying selected frequencies of ultraviolet radiation to cells that have been treated with a special chemical, genetic surgeons can alter the structures of L--\l"L,--':
,

allowing them to change the very compo-

sition of complex organic molecules. Because the exact outcome of such manipulations can be anticipated by running sophisticated computer simulations, a surgeon with enough ability and patience can easily alter a genotype to meet any specifications he desires.

cryogenically frozen clients: Cryo-Freeze deadened the subjects' ability to replace lost body cells.

At first, the enhancement process was used to simultaneously alter all the

DNA molecules in the recipient's body. But individuals altered in this fashion
suffered traumatic genetic injury and lost their enhanced capabilities as soon as their bodies replaced the majority of the altered cells with natural cells. For this reason, the earliest beneficiaries of genetic enhancement were cryogenically frozen clients of Cryo-DawnTMInc. (see Chapter One). Later, genetic engineers discovered a method of altering a subject's rnRNA, providing the body with a mechanism for reproducing altered cells and opening the door for the enhancement of living subjects.

Furthermore, in the case of truly radical enhancements like those performed on soldiers, many subjects find their newfound abilities so unsettling and unfamiliar that they lose their grip on reality. It's simply too hard for most subjects to come to grips with the fact that they are suddenly capable of lifting automobiles over their head or deflecting bullets with their bare skin.

becomes a four-color comic book character: While inside the Slumberland VR, enhancement subjects can see their own bodies and those of other enhancement subjects in full-color with photographic precision. All other objects and personalities are seen as blackand-wvhite collections of rough, polygon graphics. Because their conscious minds are not active while they are being enhanced, this mode of perception seems perfectly natural to the subjects.

"Life" inside the Slumberland i s difficult to describe. Throughout the fourteen months he or she spends in sensory deprivation, the subject experiences an entire lifetime inside the Slumberland. Each simulation begins with an artificially induced birth trauma and ends mere seconds before the subject experiences his or her own "virtual" death. Throughout the course of this simulated lifetime, the subject becomes a fourcolor comic book character: he undergoes a radiation accident that grants him fantastic powers (the exact abilities the genetic engineers are simultaneously installing in his real body), he falls in love with a headstrong girlfriend whom he must constantly rescue from the clutches of his evil adversaries, he acquires a zealous archenemy, etc.

SUBJECTS IN SLUMBERLAND EXPERIENCE A N ENTIRE LIFETIME

In the end, it is the virtual lives they have experienced that allow the boosted subjects to come to grips with their enhancements.

installed abilities as a natural and logical part of everyday life. In fact, sometimes too much of the subiect's virtual life roots itself into the subconscious. Scientists have noticed that approximately 15% of altered subjects slowly regain the "fourcolor morality" of the typical comic book character and start to view the world as a struggle between ''heroes'' and "villains" with no gray areas in between. Such subjects often develop the irrational belief that every natural disaster or calamity is the work of powerful criminal conspiracies bent on dominating all mankind. Given the current socio-economic situation, a few have even decided that the US Government itself i s a monstrous criminal conspiracy that has betrayed the ideals of the nation's founding fathers.

Veteran Programs
Although mainstream society largely shuns boosted veterans, the conflict firms and their soldiers are obviously indispensable to the economic wellbeing of the United States. As a consequence, the American government has been forced to make some concessions to the veterans so as to maintain the morale of the troops and boost the effectiveness of recruiting drives. Some of the programs the government has instituted are described below.

THE VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION

Veterans' Administration: The Veterans' Adm i nistration maintains VA
hospitals in most major cities in the United States.

All veterans are entitled to

free medical care and prescription service at any VA facility. Although this care is never the best that 2 1 st century medicine has to offer, it is certainly passable.

VA hospitals are notorious for not asking questions. Many of their patients wander in from the streets with gunshot wounds and other traumatic injuries obviously sustained while conducting illegal activities.

THE G I BILL

GI Sill: Congress passed the new GI Bill in 2016 shortly after the the First
Nicaraguan War was concluded. The

Bill was designed to provide veterans

with inexpensive housing and student loans. Unfortunately, the program's resources are so overtaxed that only a tiny percentage of the veterans that apply receive any benefits at all. Those lucky enough to be accepted into the

program receive either a very nice apartment located somewhere in Los Angeles at a rental rate of $2000 per month, or a bond for up to

$280,000 in student loans. Apartments obtained through the GI Bill can be
occupied for a maximum of three years before they are reclaimed by the agency and reassigned. Student loans can be used only to attend accredited colleges and universities.

While creating his or her veteran, each player who would like to apply for the GI Bill is allowed to roll 2D10. If the total of the two dice is greater than or equal to 17, that veteran's application is accepted and he or she can choose either the apartment or the loans. If the application is rejected, the veteran i s allowed to re-apply after one year of game time passes (same dice roll necessary for success). If this second application is also rejected, the veteran is permanently ineligible for benefits.

THE VETERANS’ FAIR HOUSING ACT

Veterans’ Fair Housing Act: Congress passed the Fair Housing Act in

Of course, housing secured through the Act is less than desirable. Typical accommodations consist of a 10’ by 18’ studio unit in a giant housing block on the west coast. And because the housing blocks are filled with so many unemployed and poverty-stricken veterans, they are universally crime-ridden and extremely dangerous.

THE VETERANS’ BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

Veterans‘ Business Administration: The VBA was created to provide
low-interest start-up loans to veterans who hope to become entrepreneurs. But owing to the fact that the program is horribly under-funded, these loans are incredibly difficult to secure. Those few veterans lucky enough to receive one can borrow up to $1,500,000 at an interest rate of 5% over ten years.

Qualifying for a loan requires a detailed business plan that demonstrates the potential for profit and a successful Legendary P/F Charisma Challenge (ie. Difficulty of 20). Due to the influence of Secretary Gore, veterans of the

TWD 4th Infantry can secure a loan with a business plan and a successful
Phenomenal Charisma Challenge (Difficulty of 15). Each veteran may receive no more than one VBA loan during the course of his lifetime.

Although a few veterans overcome the prejudices and obtain respectable employment, most are forced to make ends meet on society's fringe. Because of their special capabilities, a whole host of special opportunities are open to veterans, most of them illegal. Crime. Their enhancements and special training allow veterans to become effective and dangerous criminals and many of them take advantage of this opportunity out of economic necessity. Although most boosted hoodlums operate alone or cluster into small, loosely knit "gangs," a few have built enormous organized crime syndicates. taw enforcement. Due to the specialized threat that boosted criminals pose to the society, law enforcement organizations have resorted to employing boosted operatives of their own to keep the hoodlums in check. Most of the large cities in the United States maintain boosted police units that specialize in combating boosted criminals. Terrorism. Not only are many veterans pre-disposed toward terrorism due to the many injustices they face, they're also frequently recruited into terrorist organizations that don't concern themselves with veterans' issues. In fact, many veterans make their livings as mercenaries, using their special abilities and training in the service of any terrorist group that can meet their price. Security/Corporate Raider. Again, their specialized capabilities make veterans ideal security troops/bodyguards. Veterans are also well-suited to the role of "corporate raider'' (see Chapter One). Curiosities. Finally, some veterans use their enhancements to make livings as "oddities." This spectrum runs from the semi-respectable (movie stars who use their enhancements in their films) to the distasteful (circus freaks and "gladiators").

in society. In essence, you are forming a sort of "blueprint" that will guide you through each of the remaining steps. Perhaps a review of the background material found in this chapter as well as the information found in Chapters One and Four will help you make some of these decisions. At this point, a glance through the character archetypes found at the end of this chapter should also prove helpful.

Depending upon how your Gamemaster is structuring things, by the time you get around to forming your character concept, you and the other players may have already spent some time discussing a Campaign Goal. If so, you should obviously keep this goal in mind as you're thinking about your character. If you're goal is to clear all the drug dealers out of South-Central Los Angeles, for instance, you probably don't want to create a character who is a dope dealer herself. In any case, if possible, you should certainly spend a little time in consultation with the other players when forming your concept. Together, your goal is to create a group of characters who can work well together. With the help of the GM, the players might also cooperate to work out a "backstory" that explains how their characters met and decided to pur-

she will receive. The more money allocated, the more extensive her enhancements can be. The amount of money spent on genetic surgery determines the Skill rating of the genetic surgeon who installs your character's enhancements. The higher the surgeon's Skill rating, the more effective the enhancements. The funds allocated to reconditioning determine the size and scope of your character's reconditioning therapy. Making the therapy more extensive makes your character less susceptible to metagenic feedback trauma.

THE RULES FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS

The only two rules you must follow when allocating your funds are: You can only allocate funds to genetic surgery in the amount of

$200,000, $700,000, or $1,000,000.
You can only allocate funds to reconditioning in the amounts of

$500,000, $1,000,000, or $5000,000. And . . .
Funds must be allocated in increments of $1 00,000. Beyond these simple restrictions, anything goes.

RECRUITMENT AND ENHANCEMENT POINTS

Once you have allocated your funds, you can compute your beginning Recruitment Point and Enhancement Point totals. Both Recruitment Points and Enhancement Points are used to "purchase" abilities for your character later in the process. You receive one Recruitment Point for each $100,000 allocated to recruitment and one Enhancement Point for each $1 00,000 allocated to genetic design.

Step #3 - Recruiting/Create Personality
CREATING A PERSONALITY

I

The third step is perhaps the most important in the entire character creation process. It's now time to create your character's Personality. Even more than your Attribute and Ability ratings, your Personality will serve to define your character in the stories you create. After all, Attributes and Abilities are used only to help the Gamemaster decide the outcome of some of the special actions you attempt. Your Personality, on the other hand, helps you decide what actions to perform in the first place.
other aspects: Veteran roleplayers sometimes go so far as to create unique voices for their characters and bring unique costumes or props to game sessions.

PERSONALITIES CONSIST OF TRAITS AND CODES

In Underground, Personalities consist of Traits and Codes, either of which can be rated as Limiting or Non-limiting.

A Trait is a basic aspect of your character's outlook on life. A Trait
can be either very general (ie. 'Icurious") or very specific (ie. "curious about her best friend's past"). Although Traits describe how a character is likely to act in a given situation, they don't guarantee he will act that way.

A Code i s a rule or principle your character lives by. Examples
include: ''won't

kill,"

''won't allow herself to undergo feedback trauma,'' and

"always avenges an injustice in kind.'' Codes are a stronger influence on one's behavior than Traits; they are rarely broken.

A Limiting Trait or Code has the potential to either frequently place the
character in great danger or frequently prevent the character from accomplishing her goals. "Curious" is a good example of a Limiting Trait, while ''won't

kill" is

an example of a Limiting Code. Non-Limiting Traits and

Codes, on the other hand, have little potential to place the character in danger or prevent her from accomplishing her goals. "Curious about her best friend's past'' is a Non-Limiting Trait, while ''won't allow herself to undergo feedback trauma" is a Non-Limiting Code.

YOUMAY SELECT

Characters must select between two and five Traits, and may select up to

TWO TO FIVE
TRAITS AND UP TO TWO CODES

. Note

that your Traits and Codes can't possibly describe every

aspect of your character. Instead, they serve only to define those aspects of her psyche that best define her being. In addition to the Traits and Codes you select, you should think about other aspects of the character's Personality not covered by the Traits and Codes. What are her favorite hang-outs? What type of music does she enjoy? How does she dress and

Note that the Gamemaster must approve each Trait or Code as acceptable for play and judge each selected Trait or Code as Limiting or Non-Limiting (using the examples below as guidelines). If you are having trouble selecting traits and codes, here are a few ideas:

SAMPLE TRAITS

Limiting Traits: Curious, likes to pick fights, Fights only when pushed,
W o n ' t risk u n d e r g o i n g feedback trauma, A d d i c t e d to cocaine, Kleptomaniac, likes to prove himself superior in all situations, Hates authorifigures, Addicted to danger, etc.

AND CODES

Non-limiting Traits: Curious about his past, loves art, Wants to find an
old friend, Strong sense of humor, Never misses Aeon Flux on the vid-net, loves to seduce men, Wants to remarry ex-wife, Wants to be a rock star, Paranoid, Hypochondriac, etc.

Limiting Codes: Won't kill, Never throws the first punch, Never backs
down from a challenge, Always repays an injustice in kind, etc.

Non-Limiting Codes: Won't lie, Never "rats" on a friend, Sworn to protect a younger brother, Won't harm an animal, etc.

Step #6 - Dl,!gn Enl.,acement Program
Next, you choose the genetic enhancements you'd like your character to receive. A complete list of available genetic enhancements can be found in Chapter Seven.
SELECTING YOUK ENHANCEMENTS

To select an enhancement, you must purchase it using your Enhancement
Points. Each enhancement has a Base Cost and a Potency ranging from 1-3 listed in its description. To purchase an enhancement, compare its Potency with your desired Unit rating on the Enhancement Selection Table found on page 114. Add this result to the Base Cost to arrive at a total cost. In other words, it costs 25 Enhancement Points to purchase 12 Units of a Potency 2 enhancement with a Base Cost of

YOU CAN USE BONUSES AND LIMITATIONS TO

Since not all characters possessing a genetic enhancement manifest it in exactly the same way, many of the enhancements have ted Bor

Placing a Bonus on an enhancement increases its Potency by one level, while placing a Limitation on an enhancement reduces its Potency by one level. Whether or not you place a Bonus or

Optional Step #8 1/2 - Generate Military Career
GENERATING YOUR CAREER

This optional step allows you figure out exactly what happened to
your veteran during his or her military career. It is recommended only for more experienced players and GMs.

First, decide how long your veteran served (normally 4, 5 , or 6 years). Then, for each year you served, roll 2D10 (adding the results and NOT rerolling doubles) in each of the five categories listed below. Every time you roll the listed total or higher, you get the listed benefit or penalty.

ROLL FOR PROMOTION

Promotion (13i): The rank structure for each of the major conflict firms was detailed back in Chapter Four. You automatically begin your
career at the lowest listed rank for the firm you have chosen. Each time you roll a 13 or higher at this step, you gain a promotion to the next rank. In any case, you can never be promoted higher than the highest listed rank. Your final rank determines your demobilization benefits the amount of money you have in your pocket as play begins.

Congressional Medal of Honor (for extreme valor)

Although you can receive most of the decorations multiple times, you can receive the Medal of Honor only once. Decorations have no real effect on play, but they might help you get a better handle on your character.

Gain Confacf/Trophy (16+):Every time you gain this benefit,
you either make a friend who will serve as an important contact stateside (ie. either a boosted vet or a non-boosted bureaucrat who

might play a somewhat important part in the stories you create) or
an item you can bring to the states as a trophy-your choice. items gained in this way are usually weapons of no more than $28,000 value, though trophies can be restricted military weapons that are difficult to obtain in any other fashion. The exact contact or item you obtain is up to you and the Gamemaster.

Gain Flashback (14+):For some unknown reason, a large number of boosted vets suffer from a peculiar form of post-traumatic stress disorder that causes them to experience periodic flashbacks of particularly stressful situations they faced in combat. For instance, a vet who saw his friend burned to death might flash back to the friend's death whenever he sees a roaring flame. Players who receive this penalty should work with the GM to select a reasonably common traumatic circumstance (fire, thunder storms,

ROLL T O GAIN A FLASHBACK

rc
heights, imminent death, etc.) and an explanation of why the character has such a dramatic reaction to the circumstance. During play, whenever the character comes into contact with the chosen circumstance, he re-experiences the traumatic event that touched off the flashback and takes one Stress Point per Turn until he can somehow leave the area or cause the circumstance to go away.
takes one Stress Point per Turn: Again, Stress and how it functions will be explained in a later Chapter.

Note that it is possible to receive this penalty more than once, meaning the character experienced multiple traumatic events that prompt flashbacks.

ROLL FOR CATASTROPHE

Something Catastrophic Happens (17+):A character who
receives this penalty undergoes a catastrophe. The exact nature of the catastrophe is up to the player (with the GM’s approval). Possibilities include: gaining a hated enemy who will pose a threat stateside, losing a limb (a character missing an arm loses 6 points of DEX, a character missing a leg loses 6 points of SPD), undergoing a court-martial and obtaining a criminal record, undergoing a psyche-shattering traumatic experience (permanently lowering the character’s Tolerance by two), or just about any other catastrophe the player can invent.

AN EXAMPLE OF GENERATING A CAREER

all the requested

information. Note that if your Enhancements changed your Ratings in the Governing Attributes for any of your Skills, you should recalculate your starting Skill scores.

At this point, you should also purchase your starting equipment. All characters begin with $100,000 in savings plus their demobilization benefits of

You can't stand scum who prey on human weakness, and the veterans are the worst of the lot. They should know better. You've decided t o put your genetic enhancements a n d combat training t o work by targeting the criminals and misfits the law is either too weak or too scared to handle. Soon the criminals and corrupt politicians will learn t o fear you, and ling to enjoy being feared. You've dmitted to yourself that concern for your fellow man is not the only reason you've taken to prowling the streets. Quote: KRRUUNCHH! "One more time. Want t o tell me where I can find Rico?"

How You Make a Living: Like Political Hardcores, Vigilantes like to keep a low profile. Most work blue collar jobs or collect welfare. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $14,000.
Notes: Many Vigilantes responded unusually well to their S l u m b e r l a n d programming a n d I retain a great deal of its influence. In , essence, they are trying to recapture their identities as "comic book heroes." As a consequence, you should probably work with the GM to develop your stay in Slumberland so you can refer back t o your past life as a character bit during play. You should also work with the GM to figure out how society views your character. Some Vigilantes are hounded by the authorities, some are tacitly accepted, and others are openly endorsed. Needless to say, the option you a n d the GM choose has a n enormous impact upon how your character might fit into the stories you will invent.

'
\

y

Boons: You begin play with two street contacts (informers or small time criminals) who can sometimes provide you with valuable information. Exactly what these contacts know and how much they are willing t o help you is up t o the Gamemaster.

Suggested Goals: Taking down criminals; eliminating corruption; proving you're tough

I

There's something wrong in the home of the brave and you've decided t o do something about it. On the streets, vets who are particularly dedicated to a political agenda are known as "hardcores." They come in all different shades. Some front for the major political parties (mostly the Republocrats, though there are a few Plutocratic traitors and even the occasional NAS oddball), some are licensed activists, and some are straight-up terrorists. For a Hardcore, the cause is everything. He'd rather die than betray it. Quote: "Don't you DARE tread on me!" (motto of the Underground).

How You Make a Living: Most Hardcores hold day jobs o r collect welfare t o support their political
activities (trying to keep a low profile in their civilian guises). Some freelance for the criminal syndicates or steal the money they need. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $14,000. Notes: You must decide the exact political cause you endorse. Possibilities range from the ambitious (the Undergrounds aim of overthrowing the US Government) t o the absurd (the obliteration of the sex-vid industry). You should also decide whether you attempt t o further your cause through political action (organizing boycotts, holding rallies), violence, or both. Note that not every character with a n i n t e r e s t i n politics is a Hardcore-only those characters who build their self-images around their service to the cause.

Boons: You begin play with two Hardcore friends (not necessarily vets) who live in your vicinity and support your cause. Work with the GM t o invent details about them. These friends will indirectly assist you in your adventures, though they won't place their lives at risk for you personally or spend a great deal of their time assisting you.
Suggested Goals: Spreading the cause; crushing your political enemies.

Your enhancements have caused you enough grief over the years. Now it's time to start using them to turn a profit. You work for a big corporation. Sure you know that most of the corps are crooked, and you certainly don't like it. But it is a living. Most likely, the t corp pays you to battle your fellow vets who have turned t o crime or terrorism, and exploits you a s a walking, t a l k i n g , news-making PR machine. On the other hand, maybe you are a "corporate raider" and secretly commit crimes or terrorist acts of your own on the corp's behalf.

L

I

I~

Quote: "And remember citizens, this arrest was brought to you by the fine folks at your neighborhood Tastee Ghoul. Are you a people person?"

'

How You Make a Living: Obviously, most of your income is derived from the corporation or corporations t h a t employ I you. In return, you are generally forced to prominently display the corp's logo or slogan on your uniform so the logo can be seen in the news footage of your activities. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $50,000.

!

Notes: You should work with the Gamemaster to decide what corporation employs you and define the exact nature of your duties. Do you battle criminaldterrorists and try to make the news? Do you work as an action-adventure soma-vid star? A corporate raider?

'

Because their jobs force them to be publicity-hungry, many Spokesmen are cocky and self-centered. If you'd like to play such a character, this is an ideal archetype.

t

Boons: Generally, Spokesmen are viewed much more favorably by the general public than other veterans. Their association with corporate America has somehow made them respectable. Furthermore, you can sometimes call upon your corporate masters and their contacts for assistance.

Suggested Goals: Make a fortune; clean up the corporate sector.

?--

I Primitive

I

The world is slowly sliding down a long spiral that leads straight into the jaws of oblivion. The only way to slow this descent is to return to the ways of a more primitive and more enlightened age. Primitives are vets who share the "primitivist" philosophy outlined in Chapter One. Their greatest concern is the well-being of the tribe. Although they take advantage of technology, they tend t o mistrust it. Their ultimate goal is to undo centuries of mercantilist brainwashing and return concepts like honor, tradition, and culture to the forefront of society.
Quote: "You haven't truly experienced life until you've learned to view the world through ancient eyes."

I

b'

I

How You Make a Living: Many Primitives master traditional crafts and sell the products of their labor to survive. Others use their detailed knowledge of the lowest and seediest levels of their home cities t o make livings as informants a n d guides. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $10,000.
Notes: You should work with the GM to select a specific tribe you represent (ie. Yanomamo, Ubangi, Maori, etc). Since each tribe has different beliefs a n d customs, your choice should heavily depend upon the sort of character you want t o play. Your choice might also make you a part of a long-standing alliance or feud (in Los Angeles, for instance, the Ubangis and Yanomamos hate each other).

Boons: You can always count on minor assist a n c e from your fellow tribesmen, though you a r e obligated t o assist them in r e tu r n . Furthermore, you automatically possess intimate knowledge of your home city's lowest and most isolated areas. By passing an appropriate INT Challenge, you can recall a wide variety of facts pertaining to these regions.
Suggested Goals: Opening eyes to the joys of primitivism; attacking the consumer culture.

It’s 2021 and armageddon is undoubtedly just around the corner. There’s so much pain and suffering in the world that there’s little point in thinking about it. You can’t possibly make everyone happy. Although it’s hard to remember for certain, you can swear that you once looked forward to the future back when you were younger. But Paraguay took care of all that. Now you live for today.

Quote: “SystematicOverthrow? Boring. Short-Controlled Bursts? Boring. The Final Solutions? BORING. Hey man, where are you going? You got five bucks?”

How You Make a Living: Few Nihilists are capable of holding a real job for long. Most live off the- welfare system and the good graces of the Veterans’ Fair Housing Act. A few earn extra money by freelancing for the small-time criminal syndicates. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $12,000.
Notes: Nihilists tend to spend most of their time shufflingaround the city and trylng to keep themselves e n t e r t a i n e d . Since t h e t r u e goal of t h e Underground Nihilist is to find something she can believe in, this is an ideal archetype for players who aren’t really clear about t h e sort of character they’d like t o play. As a Nihilist, you have much more freedom to develop your ideals during play.

Somehow, Nihilists always seem to find each other. You probably spend a lot of time hanging out on street corners and in night clubs with other Nihilists.

r

Boons: Because you have so much free time, you know your environment like the back of your hand. By passing appropriate INT Challenges, you can answer all sorts of questions about your area that other characters can’t - “Where does Johnny Montana hang out? Where is Systematic Overthrow playing tonight? Where can I )me juice?,” etc.
sible Goals: Find something to care about; t r y to keep Itertained.

Cyber-Celeb
Thirty years ago, you were on top of the world. When cryo-freeze became a big fad, you had yourself frozen in the hope that you could be revived in a brave new world. Little did you know t h a t over the next two decades most of your mind would r o t away, a n d w h a t w a s left would become the heart and soul of one of the first boosted killing machines to set foot on the modern battlefield. Today, both of your former lives haunt you-your days among the glitterati and your years spent in the jungles of the Third World.
Quote: "Hiya! Heeeere's Johnny! Hiya! Heeeere's Johnny! Hiya! Heeeere's Johnny!" (repeated twelve times)

Y

How You Make a Living: Their memories of t h e i r former lives drive many Cyber-celebs back t o the entertainment field. Most work a t t h e lowest levels of t h e industry (lounge s i n g e r , magician, etc.), though a few have done quite well. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $18,000

I-

9 \

Notes: Remember, Cyber-celebs were the first boosted soldiers that were created and the program used to create them wasn't very effective. Most are slow-witted (making this archetype a good choice for characters with low INTs) and somewhat unpredictable. As you create your character, you should choose the late 80s/early 90s celebrity t h a t was used as your genetic base. Your personality is a combination of the most superficial elements of the celebrity's personality and the cynicism of an experienced soldier.

Boons: Because you once underwent cryofreeze, you are less susceptible to the effects of metagenic feedback trauma. You begin play with a base Tolerance of 12.
Suggested Goals: Recapturing your former fame.

Criminal
about survival. It's about getting yours. The biggest players in the whole damn game are Foster and all his Congressmen. They know the score. Why should you be left out? You live outside the law and make your money any way you can, whether you're a street hustler or a n inside trader (same difference). But money isn't everything. Your racket is also about respect. In the end, respect is the only thing that can buy you safety. The minute you lose it, you're dead.
Quote: "Trying to move on me? I'll bury those cockroaches!"

m

How You Make a Living: The game can be pretty lucrative. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $25,000.
Notes: You have a lot of decisions to make. First, you should decide the exact nature of your criminal activities. Are you a small time hood? A gang-banger? A burglar? A dope dealer? You should also work with the GM t o decide whether or not you have any partners in crime and flesh-out your exact relationship with them. Finally, you should t r y t o decide what you do with the money you earn. Are you only out for yourself? Or, like Robin Hood, do you share your ill-gotten gains?

Needless to say, being a criminal is a dangerous profession. You will attract the attention of law enforcement operatives, government spies, and other criminals everywhere you go.

Boons: You begin play with three street contacts. These contacts might be informers, corrupt law enforcement officials, or your partners in crime. You can count on limited assistance from your contacts, b u t you a r e obligated to assist them in return.

'

Possible Goals: Expanding the size of your criminal empire; eliminating your opposition.

I

Sure the system’s corrupt, but what’s the alternative? Lawlessness? Sometimes you’re convinced that the criminals and activists pose an even greater danger to society than the grafted double-dealers they hope to eliminate. Better off working t o change things from the inside. Because of your special capabilities, you’re still quite useful to the authorities. Someone must stand up against all the boosted terrorists and criminals on their territory, and you’re one of the few with both the skills and the desire. Of course, now that you’re the Man, some of your fellow vets view you as a traitor. But you’re not losing any sleep. You’ve got plenty of friends. Quote: “Don’t cross me, chief. I’ve got friends in fly places.“ How You Make a Living: You receive a monthly salary from the government agency that employs you. As play begins, you have a monthly income of $25,000.
Notes: You should cooperate with the GM to work out your exact connection with the government. You might be a member of a special tactical police unit that investigates boosted criminals, a special operative who spies on big business for the FBI, a member of an elite federal antiterrorism agency, or even a member of the hated AntiSedition Squad. In any case, your exact duties should be geared to your enhancements. The government doesn’t exactly trust vets and hires them only when they are particularly useful.

Boon: As a government agent, you have certain perks and privileges, the exact nature of which depends upon the position you occupy. Police officers, for example, have access to crime scenes and criminal records, members of the Anti-Sedition Squad have access to free speech files, etc.
Possible Goals: Clean up corruption in your agency; stomp out a particular criminal or terrorist organization.

flips and rolls. Dodge is a very important Specialty
possessed by most Underground characters. In combat, characters with the Dodge Specialty may use their Dodge ratings as the Difficulty of all ranged weapon shots aimed at them in place of their DEXs.

Example: A character with a Unit Rating of 5 in
Acrobatics who

falls 50 feet (7 Units) is treated as though he has fallen only 15 feet (2 Units) for damage purposes.

Each Intimidation attempt allows the Intimidator to target a number of characters equal to his or her Intimidation Unit Rating and takes one full Turn to complete, during which the Intimidator can take no other actions. Such an attempt is resolved as a Standard Challenge with a Difficulty equal to the WILL
of the target. If multiple characters are targeted, use the

electronic devices or repair electronic devices that have been damaged. To determine how long an attempt to create an item takes (in 8-hour days), divide the price (in dollars) of a comparable item by

1000. Creating an item is a P/F Challenge with a
Difficulty determined by the GM (common items are Difficult, truly revolutionary items are Legendary). Creating an item also costs money (three times the cost of a comparable item). Both the time it takes and the money necessary to create an item can be reduced by increasing the Difficulty of the attempt (halving either is Very Difficult, quartering either i s Phenomenal). Items are repaired in the same fashion they are created except repair attempts take 1/10 the normal time and cost no money (unless the GM rules otherwise).

In play, these Enhancements function differently from the others in that their Unit Ratings are not directly used for any purpose. Instead, their Ratings tell you how many Units to add to a corresponding Attribute. By raising your Attribute Ratings in this fashion you can increase them to superhuman levels (ie. beyond 6).

genotype: the genetic niakeup

of an organism.

Like many forms of great power, genetic enhancement comes at great cost. Although doctors and scientists have unlocked many of the secrets housed in the alien space pod that crash-landed in 1996, there are still a few barriers in the realm of genetic engineering that have yet to be crossed. Despite the fact that completely re-engineering a genotype from top to bottom is now a fairly routine (though expensive) procedure, even the best genetic engineers don’t fully comprehend all the implications of their activities. The most worrisome of these misunderstood side effects is the strange connection between the integrity of the genotype and mental stability.

3nce genetic scientists overcame the cellular regeneration problem and earned to enhance living subiects, one of the first obstacles they encounered was their patients’ irksome tendency to go insane. At first, the engileers thought this problem stemmed entirely from the inability of the subjects’ )rains to accept something as alien and absurd as their newly installed abiliies. And of course, Dr. Bushmiller proved that therapies designed to help the r a i n accept the genetic implants (like the Slumberland simulation) are enornously helpful in controlling the psychological traumas associated with

But recently, scientists learned that simple "reality rejection" cannot entire1 explain enhancement trauma. In 2014, Dr. David Sanders of Corne University proved that certain types of genetic enhancement have an ine: plicable effect upon the dopamine centers in the human brain. Two year later, Sampson linked enhancement with irregular quantities of three othe catecholamine neurotransmitters. The practical upshot of all this is that gene ic enhancement mysteriously imbalances certain important chemicals in th

Detailed Rules
1. Each time you use one of your Enhancements, you accumulate a
number of Stress points equal to the final Stress value of that Enhancement (ie. the Stress value listed in its description plus or minus any bonuses or penalties you picked up during Step #8 of character creation). Note that Stress is accumulated regardless of ttemptel - 1 . . . . . whether c

is

pertectly

possible to have an Enhancement with a 0 Stress Rating, meaning that use of that Enhancement does not accumulate any Stress at all.

Enhancements listed as Continuous Stress: ie. those with a "C" in the Stress entry

l

There is one important exception to this rule: using Enhancements listed as Continuous Stress never accumulates any Stress. In other words, you don't receive Stress for using your Boosted Strength to lift

2. Once you have accumulated a Stress total that is greater than or
equal to your Tolerance, you must begin passing WILL Challenges in order to fight off the effects of your Psychosis. Immediately upon exceeding your Tolerance and each time you take Stress thereafter, you must pass a Difficult P/F WILL Challenge (Difficulty of 3) or you immediately manifest your Psychosis.

Melancholia: Characters who manifest this Psychosis become abnormally

The length of a bout of Melancholia is determined using the same rules used to determine the length of a Catatonia episode. Once the bout ends, the psychotic's Stress total is immediately reduced to one point less than his Tolerance.

Multiple Personality Disorder: Characters with this Psychosis have a
second submerged personality embedded within their minds. When the Psychosis manifests itself, this personality bubbles to the surface and becomes dominant. In effect, the sufferer becomes an entirely new character.

these secondary personalities are diametrically opposed to the psychotic's primary or dominant personality. In other words, the secondary personality

of a fearsome bully might be a meek little girl (there is nothing that says the
secondary personality must be the same sex as the primary). Once the Psychosis manifests itself, the player should begin reflecting the new personality in her role-playing.

approval of the GM: The G M should prohibit the psychotic from selecting a person or item that is actually harmful. For instance, an enemy can never be the target of true paranoia. If the target of the psychotic’sparanoia is soniehow eliminated or destro!rd before the psychotic regains control, a new target is immediately selected.

The length of time over which the secondary personality remains dominant is calculated using the same rules for calculating the length of a Catatonia episode, except Psychology cannot reduce the time of domination at all. Instead a character with the Psychology/Therapy Specialty can make one attempt to pass a P/F Challenge against a Difficulty of 9 (Impressive task) to immediately restore the character’s primary personality.

Once the psychotic’s dominant personality i s restored, his Stress total is immediately reduced to one point less than his Tolerance.

Panic Disorder: Manifesting this Psychosis causes the psychotic to sudden-

ly panic and lose confidence. As a consequence, he immediately flees from
any dangerous situation (combat, walking a roof ledge, travelling to a rough part of town, etc.) and refuses to enter another for as long as the attack lasts. Characters suffering from Panic Disorder may overcome its effects by passing a P/F WILL Challenge against a Difficulty of 9 (Impressive action) for each Turn they wish to remain in contact with danger.

The length of a Panic Disorder attack is calculated using the same rules used to calculate the length of a Catatonia episode.

Once the panicking character regains his senses, his Stress Rating is immediately reduced to one point below his Tolerance.

Paranoia: This Psychosis causes the character to focus on a particular character or item and irrationally arrive at the conclusion that this person or item will harm him. Each time the Psychosis manifests itself, the psychotic chooses a new person or item to fear (subiect to the

then make every possible effort to flee or destroy this object and may take no other actions until he is absolutely certain that he is safe. Again, this is a good opportunity for some role-playing.

Once the paranoid character regains his senses, his Stress Rating is immediately reduced to one point below his Tolerance.

Fortunately, metagenic feedback trauma and its associated Psychoses can be partially controlled through medication. Each Psychosis has an associated therapeutic drug. Each and every day a character takes the proper dosage of the drug that matches her Psychosis, she may receive a bonus to her Tolerance for that day.

After a character who has manifested a Psychosis recovers, his medication will not give him any additional benefits for the remainder of the current day. In other words, a character with a Tolerance of 8 who received 2 additional points of Tolerance due to medication but manifested his Psychosis anyway, must begin undergoing WILL Challenges to avoid manifesting the Psychosis again once he equals or exceeds 8 Stress (not 10).

Like our own, the world of Underground is a dark and violent place where the strong take what they want and the weak try to survive on the leftovers.

This savagery takes on many forms, the simplest of which provides the topic
for this chapter.

In Underground‘s 2021, it i s amazing what a few well-placed holes in all
the right heads can accomplish. As a consequence, combat of all sorts is

likely to become a staple of the stories you are about to create. Your veterans might be called upon to defend themselves against angry gang members, overzealous government agents, and callous terrorists; or they might just as easily find themselves on the offensive against any one of these groups or dozens of others. Remember, in 2021, much of urban America is heavily armed, willing, and able, meaning that even the most modest arguments sometimes escalate into full-scale wars.

Movement
In combat, movement i s one of the most common actions selected by the combatants. As you read back in Chapter Three, a character (or obiect) can move a distance equal to his or her SPD in a single Turn if walking, a distance equal to his or her SPD+3 if trotting, and a distance equal to his or her

But at the same time, moving at running SPD during a Turn increases the Difficulty of the To Hit Challenges

of all characters targeting you during that Turn. You'll read more about these
movement modifiers later in the section.

Evading
Sometimes, a combatant i s far more interested in avoiding punishment than dishing it out. Such characters often choose a special action known as evaEVASION IS USkD

sion. A character who evades during a Turn automatically increases the
Difficulty of all To Hit Challenges aimed at him during that Turn. Note that although evasion is an Automatic Action, it is impossible for a single character to evade and conduct an attack during the same Turn. Any character who evades is barred from attacking during her Turn, though the evasion does not prevent her from conducting any other action involving a Challenge.

Characters can only sprint (SPD+6) for an amount of time equal to their RES scores plus 10.Thereafter, they must slow t o a trot (SPD+6) due to the effects of fatigue. This rule has two important effects on play. *First, after a battle has lasted a number of Turns equal to the character's RES score plus 10,she can no longer move at running SPD, regardless of whether or not she ran at all earlier in the battle (simply being in combat is very tiring). *And second, since even the toughest characters quickly slow due to fatigue, outside of combat, you should only allow characters to move at running SPD to cover very short distances. In other words, if you want to determine how long it takes a character to reach a bomb located two hundred yards away, allow him t o use his running SPD. But if you want to calculate how long it will take a character to cross a park that is two or three miles long, limit him to jogging SPD.

attack a target that has yet to take a Turn, before the attack is resolved, that target has an opportunity to announce whether or not he plans to evade or move at run SPD during his Turn. If he elects to run or evade at this point, he cannot change his mind later.

To Hit Challenges are always P/F; you either hit your target or you miss.

Regardless of the number of shots fired at a target, the entire attack is still resolved with a single To Hit Challenge and a single Penetration Challenge, but each additional shot fired past the first decreases the Difficulty of the shooter's To Hit and Penetration Challenges by 1.

FIRING MULTIPLE SHOTS AT A TARGET INCREASES YOUR CHANCES TO HIT AND DAMAGE THAT TARGET

When dividing shots between multiple targets, resolve the attack on each target as a separate To Hit and Penetration Challenge (including any bonuses for multiple shots fired at the target).

Immediately after a battle concludes, a character with the Medicine/First Aid Specialty can attend to the wounded by attempting a P/F Challenge against a Difficulty equal to the Difficulty the victim would face if she was attempting a Recovery Challenge (ie. if the victim's Wound Level is LW, the Difficulty of the First Aid attempt i s 3, etc).

Note that each character may receive First Aid only once and only immediately after a battle in which she was wounded.

Furthermore, just before a wounded character attempts a Recovery Challenge, a character with the Medical Treatment Specialty can attempt to treat the wounded character and assist her.

When a Surprise is sprung, the GM should ask one of the victims to attempt a P/F INT Challenge to detect the attackers. If this Challenge fails, all of the characters on the Surprised side can take no actions during the first Turn of combat.

some combat situations: For example, when a character suddenly whirls around to attack a friend or has such a

Throwing and Breaking Things
As you read back in Chapter Three, a character can throw an object a distance equal to her STR minus the object's weight. Throwing an object at another character is treated like any other attack. The thrower uses his DEX during the To Hit Challenge, and the Penetration of the attack is equal to the object's weight. You can determine the damage inflicted by the attack by assuming the target was punched by a character with a STR equal to the object's weight and consulting the hand-to-hand damage table in the previous section

The monthly salary you receive from your chosen archetype isn't nearly high enough to cover some of these items. Here are some thoughts on how to make additional money.

1)Criminals, terrorists, and (sometimes) vigilantes steal what they need. Average scores range from $3500 (knocking off a convenience store) to $1,500,000 (a major bank heist). 2) Lots of people (criminals, corporate raiders, government agents looking to cover their tracks, etc.) are looking to hire vets for a little extra-curricular activity. Fees earned for pulling jobs like this typically range from $7,000 to $350,000, depending upon the nature of the job and its associated dangers.
3) You can always turn to the Business Skill to increase your worth (see Chapter Six).

4)And last but not least, the street smart always know how to scare up a few extra bucks. Collecting and recycling the brass shell casings left a t the scene of a battle earns 2D10 dollars; salvaging the weapons and equipment of the fallen nets you 20% of each item's cost; and the VA gives you $500 every time you give
blood (maximum of once per week).

Firearms
Unless otherwise noted, all firearms described in this section feature a built-in microprocessor and digital information relay. Because of these features, the owner can plug the firearm into a portable computer (by means of a thin, flexible cord). With the proper software, the computer can: project a running ammunition count inside the owner's combat goggles, run routine maintenance diagnostics on the gun, and help the owner aim. See Computers, below. Furthermore, unless otherwise noted, all firearms described in this section are assumed to feature built-in laser sights (a beam that projects a little red dot on the target - think back to just about any Arnold Schwarzeneger movie).

Pistols

The Punk-Roaster i s the modern incarnation of the 20th century flamethrower. The user wears a heavy tank filled with fuel on his back. If this tank is ruptured (use the rules for damaging objects, a Called Shot is necessary to hit the tank), the projector immediately resolves a Penetration Challenge against its user and no longer functions.

Note: Because it uses heat and fire to inflict damage,
armor.

the Punk-Roaster's Penetration ignores most forms of body

Turbo Tazer (Cost: $50,000, Avail: D) Accuracy: 3, Penetration: 12, Dmg: Special, Rng: 2/4/6, Ammo: 1, Rate: 1, STR: 7, RES: 10
The turbo tazer fires a pair of wires into a target and then sends an immobilizing current down those wires. The Penetration Challenge of a tazer attack is P/F. If the Challenge succeeds, the target must make a successful P/F RES Challenge against a Difficulty of 12 or fall unconscious immediately (as if affected by a KO result).

GIass ................................... .-6 Wood .................................. .7 Brick .................................... 13 Concrete .... ..... 15 Stone ..... ..... 16 Brixblox.. .... ..... 17 Steel .................................... 18

STR: 0.RES: +2
Heavykev is a lightweight, durable ballistic fabric that was created using insights gleaned from the downed alien space pod. In 202 1, most all military and police uniforms, trenchcoats, and jackets are fashioned from it. It is generally impossible to combine the effects of several types of armor (ie. wear Mondo and Heavy Mondo at the same time). Heavykev, however, may be worn in combination with either Mondo or Heavy Mondo armor.

Note:

Chaff (Cost: $3000, Avail: B)
Chaff packs aren't really armor. They are small canisters of shredded aluminum that can be affixed to a Mondo, Heavy Mondo, or Heavykev vest. When the wearer i s targeted by a radar-homing weapon, one of the chaff packs automatically fires, confusing the weapons radar and adding +15 to the Difficulty of the weapon's To Hit Challenge.

In order to use chaff packs, the user must also carry a portable computer and a radar detector. A complete package consists of three canisters, each usable one time only.

Ammunition
Ten rounds for any of the firearms listed above cost $75. Special weapons, like the Pumpit and the Napalm Projector, are completely reloaded at a cost of $400.

equipment
Vehicles
In 2021, automobiles are still the vehicles of choice, though there are now a few other options. All Vehicles have a special Ability Rating, Handling, that i s added to the Skill Rating of the driver when she performs Vehicle Skill Checks.

Automobiles and Cycles
Tehran Jihad (Avail: C, Cost: $175,000) ;: I3 Handling: 0 , SPD: 14,
Ever since the United btates rebuilt Iranian industry after overthrowing the Islamic Fundamentalist government in 1998’s Operation Overthrow the Fundamentalists, the Iranians have dominated the world auto industry. In 202 1, the most popular Iranian model is Tehran Motors’ Jihad, a rugged compact.

Flying Vehicles
Personal Aircar (Avail: C, Cost: $1,500,000) Handling: 0, SPD: 17, RES: 14
Aircars are much like normal automobiles except for the fact that they can fly. The cars are quite fast when moving horizontally, but climb and dive at an extremely slow speed (SPD of 4 when climbing and diving). N o w that most large American cities have built upward as well as outward, aircars are not uncommon, particularly among the upper class. In fact, in Los Angeles and other large cities, there are "freeways" (roped-off areas) specially built for aircar travel.

Airboard (Avail: A, Cost: $130,000) Handling: + I , SPD: 14, RES: 7
Airboards are small, flying skateboards. Originally, they were built and marketed as a toy for the wealthy (the 2021 equivalent of the jet-ski). But over time, the boards became the favorite means of transportation among the more successful street crashers and criminals. In fact, the boards are now so well-connected with criminals that some cities are beginning to outlaw them or restrict their use.

Computers
As noted previously, almost everything in the world of Underground is digital, allowing just about anything to be connected to a computer.
Computers have two special Ability Ratings: Storage and Processing. Storage reflects the number of programs the computer can hold at one time. Processing indicates the number of programs the computer can simultaneously run. Each program has its own Memory Rating indicating the total memory space it consumes. Thus, a computer can store a group of programs with total Memory Ratings that are less than or equal to its Storage Rating and can run a group of programs with total Memory Ratings that are less than or equal to its Processing Rating. Switching the programs in storage is an Automatic Action that takes fifteen minutes (24 Units) to complete. Switching the programs being processed i s an Automatic Action that takes two minutes (15 Units) to complete, and the new programs moved into Processing must be contained in the computer's Storage.

Average Pack (Avail: A, Cost: $32,000) 'age: 13, Processing: 7 , RES: 7
"Packs" are portable battery-operated computers (roughly the size of a 20th century transistor radio) worn on the chest, back, or upper arm. They are carried by businessmen and street criminals alike. Most packs function for three days on a single battery charge.

equipment
Economy Pack (Avail: A, Cost: $25,000) Storage: 12, Processing: 6, RES: 7
Again, these statistics represent the cheap knock-offs of the average packs described above.

Vehicle Computer (Avail: A, Cost: Cost: $22,000) Storc 14, Prc ;sing: 7 , RES: 7
Most computer manufacturers now build models designed to be installed in vehicles.

Programs
Pueblo Sniper! (Avail: A, Cost: $12,000)
Memory: 3 Takes input from a gun's scope and photo enhances it. A shooter using Sniper! who aims for one full Turn (no other actions possible) can reduce the Long Range Difficulty modifier to +4 or the Medium Range Difficulty Modifier to +2.

read a location sensor on your gun and project your exact aiming point inside your combat goggles;, and it can automatically evaluate the threat posed by an enemy. The aiming function reduces the Medium and tong Range Difficulty modifiers by one each (the effects of Firefight! and Sniper! are not cumulative). The threat evaluation forces the GM to rate any character you see as a "low," "moderate," or "high" threat based upon the character's STR and RES (total STR and RES of 0 to 10 i s a low threat, from 1 1-20 is a moderate threat, and 2 1 + is a high threat). To make these evaluations, the computer actually measures the target's size and makes guesses as to the sort of genetic enhancements he or she might possess.

Eliza (Avail: A, Cost: $3,000) Mer y: 2
Eliza is a virtual receptionist. The program answers your phone and screens your calls and faxes, keeps track of your appointments, and faxes off replies to many simple inquiries. Eliza can even be programmed to manifest one of three basic personalities (sultry, chipper, or motherly/fatherly) in either sex. Many businessmen use Eliza in conjunction with a pack to screen calls and faxes to their portable cellulars.

Skill Software (Avail: B, Cost: $4000*) Memory: * Skill software duplicates the effects of Skill Specialties. For example, a Science/Biology program can evaluate a
specimen scanned through a gunsight, video camera, or any other appropriate device with a digital relay and identify it as though the computer i s a character with the Science/Biology Specialty. Note that unless it is attached to some sort of robotic arms or manipulators (which are extremely rare and expensive), the computer can't actually "do" anything (it can't conduct Medical Treatment, for example). Thus, Skill Software i s generally usable only to duplicate the knowledge functions of the various Skill Specialties. Programs for just about every appropriate Specialty are available. Such programs cost $4000 per Unit of Skill Rating and have a Memory value equal to their Skill Ratings. In other words, a program with the Science/Biology Specialty rated at 4 Units costs $16,000 and has a memory value of 4.

Home Appliance Software (Avail: A, Cost: $3000) Memory: 2
Home Appliance Systems connect and run all the digital items in a home or office, making it possible to essentially "program" your entire house-you can set the lights or any other appliance to turn on or off at any time, you can have your VCR check your answering machine and tape a program you specified in a message, and just about any other imaginable application.

Pueblo Maplt! (Avail: A, Cost: $18,000)
t'ueblo Maplt! i s a collection of cartographic software designed to generate and display maps. Once the program is activated (an instantaneous Automatic Action), it begins automatically mapping any ground the user covers, so long as the pack is connected to a pair of combat goggles, a video camera, a gun sight, or any other visual receptor with a digital relay. The maps the program generates [and the user's location on those maps) can be printed to hardcopy or projected "heads up'' to combat goggles. Maplt! can also be used to display pre-recorded maps in the same fashion. Individual map modules are available for most urban areas at a cost of $6,000 each.

Porta-Term (Avail: A, Cost: $9,000)
yorta-lerm is a communications package that allows a computer to gain remote access to various networks and systems. It can also be used to link two computers in order to download/upload data. Porta-Term is useless unless the computer running it i s connected to a phone line.

library load (Avail: A, Cost: $3000) Memory: 2
Library loads are electronic encyclopedias that contain general knowledge on a wide variety of topics. Dozens of volumes, each with its own specialty, are available. Exactly what information can be found in a Library Load is up to the GM (use the encyclopedia metaphor for guidance).

Vehicle Navigation/Maintenance (Avail: A, Cost: $8000) Memory: 3 This program is the ultimate driving aid. It tracks a vehicle's speed, position, fuel consumption, and other vitals;
runs a constant diagnostic on all vehicle systems, issuing frequent reports; and monitors local traffic reports and offers efficient route suggestions. The program's output can be projected on combat goggles or a vehicle heads up display, or to a video monitor located inside the vehicle.

Pueblo Recordlt! (Avail: A, Cost: $10,000) Memory: 4
Recordlt! accepts audible or visual information through a microphone or video camera and records it in digital format. Each hour of audio or video recorded takes up one point of the computer's Storage.

Anti-Radar (Avail: A, Cost: $8,000) Memory: 1 This program constantly monitors the output of a PunkbusterTMradar detector. When a radar-guided attack i s imminent, the program displays a warning to the user's combat goggles and automatically fires a chaff pack (if present).

Vocalizer (Avail: A, Cost: $1 5,000) Memory: 2 A simple software-based voice synthesizer, the vocalizer gives any other program the power of speech. It is particularly useful with Eliza and

Skill Software.

Computer Peripherals
laser Printer (Avail: A, Cost: $20,000) This portable battery-operated printer (the size of a large book) can create a hardcopy of any program's output. With an optional $300 strap, it can be worn on the back or chest. Video Camera (Avail: A, Cost: $1 8,000) This is a tiny video-cam (the size of a pen) that draws its power from the connected computer. It is used to provide
computer programs with visual input. Note that combat goggles and gunsights can also provide digital visual input, but not nearly as clear as the signal provided by this device.

Microphone (Avail: A, Cost: $5,000)
The microphone provides a computer with audio input. It is the size of a stick of gum and draws its power from the connected corn puter .

Bio-Drive (Avail: B, Cost: $10,000,000)
Created from discarded human brains, bio-drives are the ultimate storage medium. Although the drives are large and clunky, any computer connected to one has a Storage of 150.

equipment
Robots
Scientists constructed semi-sentient machines as early as 201 1 . At the heart of most of these so-called "robots" is a cerebral cortex that was removed from an animal and heavily modified to lend processing power and storage capacity to the computers that drive them. In game terms, robots are treated like characters. Although they are incapable of making Recovery Challenges, they can be repaired just like any other device. Robots always sport very simple programming that only allows them to make easy, rudimentary decisions. Although some can manifest a simple personality, scientists are still far from producing a machine that can fool anyone into believing it i s truly "alive."

Artificial Brains
Selling one's brain for cash to the bio-drive manufacturers before the brain iackers take it and sell it themselves isn't the only reason to install an artificial brain (known on the street as an "a-brain") these days. Most of the newer

models are programmed to keep their recipients happy and productive. The happiness feature has been especially potent since the major entertainment manufacturers began producing works specifically designed to please the most popular models of artificial brain. Once a character has an artificial brain installed, her INT drops to -3 and she loses all her INT-based Skills and approximately half the memories from her previous life (when important, you can flip a coin to determine whether or not the character remembers something). Characters with artificial brains generally manifest happy, semi-oblivious personalities. Popular models (XI1 170, TZ8, LX series, the XM70 immortalized in the songs of the Cracker Brothers) sell for $140,000, but most of the bio-drive companies will provide you with an a-brain at no charge at the time you sell your biological brain.

Street Gangs in 2021
Crime, drug abuse, and street gangs are major problems in every major American urban center. Typically, gang activity in each city is split between two o r three major factions, each consisting of dozens of allied gangs. Because expensive suits and other status symbols are popular with gang members, the various factions frequently identify themselves by the style of suit they wear. In Los Angeles, for example, the rival gangs are the People (who wear gray flannel) and the Folks (who wear tweed). In most cities, rivalry between gang factions is bitter and deadly. Consequently, in many parts of Los Angeles, accidentally wearing the wrong style thread into gang turf can easily get an innocent bystander killed. The individual gangs that ally to make up a faction generally consist of between five and fifty members and reign over a piece of “turf” that ranges from a single city block to four or five square miles. Methods the gangs use t o make money include: selling narcotics (particularly “juice”),theft, “brainjacking” (forcefully stealing the brain of an innocent bystander and selling it to an unscrupulous computer company for use as a bio-drive), and performing special “errands” for unscrupulous corporations and government agencies.

Big Businessman
INT: 3, WILL: 3, AURA: 3 Business: 6, Charm: 4
Background: Big Businessmen sit atop the vast corporations that have made the world of 2021 so gloomy. Although a few are liberal idealists, most are greedy, vicious, and unsympathetic. You can always recognize a big businessman by the six or eight flunkies he has in tow. Quote: "Perkins, I don't care how many people you're killing. The second that market share dips below 33, you're fired." Suggested Uses: Big Businessmen might serve as targets for politically minded vets or hire the vets to serve as corporate raiders.

Crooked Politician
INT: 3, AURA: 4 Charm: 6
Background: Crooked politicians are the tools of big businessmen and vice versa. Although they almost always begin with good intentions, they eventually lose touch with their constituents and acquire an unhealthy interest in influence peddling and pork-barrel programs that benefit their allies in politics and business. Crooked Politicians are always smart enough to cover their tracks. Those who aren't don't stay on the scene for long. Quote: "Let's cut the crap, Leo. The entitlement is no problem. Why don't we discuss what's in it for me?" Suggested Uses: Like Big Businessmen, Crooked Politicians might serve as targets for politically minded vets, or they might hire the vets to perform one of their patented dirty tricks.

Background: The Gangster i s a different sort of businessman. Whereas the Big Businessman makes his fortune by taking steps to guarantee that the rules are always made in his favor, the Gangster's strategy is based upon ignoring the rules altogether. Gangsters can be dangerous enemies or powerful allies.

Quote: "Here's three for your head, punk!"
Suggested Uses: A gangster might develop a vendetta against the vets or try to snare them into participating in his criminal activities.

On the other hand, he might be willing to use his influence to provide the vets with valuable information or assistance.

Background: In 202 1, special government operatives are common: members of the hated Anti-Sedition Squad track down insurrection-

ists, the FBI pursues the more prominent gangsters, several federal agencies try to keep the vets and terrorists in line, and a few members of the Department of Veterans' Affairs are rumored to be cooperating with boosted criminals.
Quote: "Shut your mouth and do what I tell you. Do you have any idea how much trouble Uncle Sam can make for you?" Suggested Uses: If the vets are operating outside the law, they're bound to attract the attention of government agents sooner or later.

Fortunately, many are corrupt and willing to make deals.

Background: The Peace Force is the LAPD's special tactical unit that was organized to deal with boosted criminals. All Peace Force officers are boosted veterans themselves. Quote: "Sure vets have it hard, but that ain't no excuse to quit. Look at me. I was in Paraguay, I saw my best friends killed, and 1'11 be

Suggested Uses: If the vets find themselves in conflict with the law, it won't be long before they're tackling the Peace Force. Typically,

Peace Force officers travel in aircars carrying four officers each.

Background: Due to sharply rising crime rates, police officers are more common (and more heavily armed) in 2021 than their 20th century counterparts. You can use these statistics to represent security officers, private investigators, and bodyguards as well as detectives and beat cops. Quote: "Freeze scumbag. Let's see some ID."

Background: In 202 1 , hardly a day passes in a major American metropolis without the sudden violence of a car-bombing, kidnapping, or hiiacking. Causes endorsed by the terrorists range from the secession o f Idaho, to the obliteration o f three-dimensional entertainment, to a ban on the dumping o f toxic wastes. Quote: “The members o f the People’s Front for the Preservation o f Navajo Sanctity are not criminals.

The Underground

I
I -

I

The first attacks carried out against US Government installations by the group now known as the Underground took place in 2016. Since 2018, various federal authorities (including the Anti-Sedition Squad, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Security Agency) have devoted enormous resources t o shattering the Underground and identifying its leaders. Although the exact origins of the Underground remain shrouded in mystery, a number of top genetic counselors have speculated that the organization was founded by veterans who were affected by the Slumberland programming in an unexpected fashion. According to this theory, some vets absorb the “four-color” morality of the Freedom League and have a tendency to enter a state in which they view life as a struggle between forces of “good and “evil.” Because the American government of 2021 has more in common with the four-color master criminals than any other institution of the modern world, the vets decided the government was evil and lashed out. Although there is lots of clinical evidence to partially support this theory, federal authorities have certainly identified and captured some Undergrounders with an absolutely unimpaired perception of reality. Whatever its origins, the Underground has adopted the rhetoric and ideals of the 18th century American patriots and alleges that the current American government has betrayed these ideals. Most offensive to the Undergrounders are government policies that curb freedom (the anti-free speech Amendments), entrench classism (pork-barrel programs and subsidies that help the rich get richer and the poor get poorer), promote warfare as a brutal instrument of policy (using militant corporations to invade Third World countries solely for economic gain); and subvert equality (the failure of government agencies to protect the civil rights of various minority groups). Ultimately, the Underground aims for nothing less than the overthrow of the American government. Although it routinely carries out acts of terrorism to achieve this aim (murdering corrupt politicians, attacking government facilities, destroying government property, etc.), its most powerful weapon is undeniably propaganda. All over the country, Undergrounders routinely tap into local vid-net lines to broadcast propaganda directly to the American people. These pirate broadcasts, known as “Channel Zero,” consist of canned (but passionate) political speeches and frequently include “hid-vid footage of corrupt politicians in action. Although the American people seem to respond t o the anti-government messages, most distrust the Undergrounders themselves as much as they distrust any other veterans.

This material will be expanded upon and supplemented in the Underground Gamemaster's Guide due in 1994.

Six Tips for Good Gamemastering
KEEP CONTROL

the worst thing that can

1. Take Control of the Game. Some players become so wrapped up in
the game that they begin to argue with the GM and question her decisions, hoping to gain an implausible advantage for their characters. Under no circumstances should you accept such misbehavior. There's nothing wrong with players who offer the occasional brief and friendly persuasive argument, but you should never allow a player to whine about a decision or carry on at length. Such behavior ultimately slows down the story and spoils the enjoyment of everyone.

rule Likewise,

Similarly, just as you shouldn't allow the players to take control of the game, neither should you allow the dice to seize control of the game. Feel free to ignore the dice rolls when necessary in order to make a scene or event more dramatic. But don't invoke this option too often. If the players see that you are abandoning the dice altogether, they'll start to get the idea that you've already decided how the story should resolve itself, making them feel isolated and their actions seem irrelevant.

if you don't like some of the rules, fer1 tree to change or ignore them. You might also consider expanding upon some

of the existing rules or creating
additional options for the playcrs. In any case, if vou dccide to tamper \vith the basic rules in this fashion, it is usually a good itlea to alcrt the players in advance and discuss specific changes. It is important that the players have at least sonir itlea of \I hat to expect.

2. Make a Decision and Live with It. Although it i s occasionally
important to stop and think for a moment before making a decision, never spend too much time thinking your way through such situations. Again, long pauses slow down the story. Generally, it is much better to be prompt and vague than ponderous and accurate. For instance, if one of your players wants to lift a pickup truck over her head during a story and you have no idea how much the truck weighs, make a quick estimate and get on with the game. Don't stop play to dig up that special "all pick-up issue'' of Consumer Reports. If you later found out you were wrong, then you were wrong. Next time, you'll know better.

DON'T BE INDECISIVE

Similarly, if you can't remember a specific rule during play, don't spend more than a minute or two looking for it. If you can't find the rule and none of the players can help you out, just make your own rule for the time being and switch to the real rule once you finally stumble across it. After all, the rules are meant to be a tool, not a pain in the neck.

If you find it hard to assign a Difficulty Number or make a rules decision during play, see if there is some way you can base the Difficulty or decision on a Unit measurement. That's why we built the Unit scale into the game. In other words, suppose one of your players tips over a 200

spilling chemicals all over the floor. How much floor space do the chemicals cover? Well, the drum weighs 200

NUMBER5

Ibs or 3 Units, so the chemicals cover 3

Units of floor space, or 100 square feet (a ten foot by ten foot area). Similarly, suppose the vets are trying to read a TWD field manual in time to disarm a TWD bomb mere minutes before it explodes. What i s the Difficulty of such an attempt? Well, if the manual is the length of a term paper (15 Units), the Difficulty is 15.

TREAT ALL PLAYERS FAIRLY

3. All Players are Created Equal. Sometimes, you will be tempted to
favor or slight certain players. Perhaps the player in question is a very good friend or has created a character that you are particularly fond of. You should always be alert for these situations and do your best to insure that you treat all players equally. If one player i s receiving an unfair edge or lia-

at least one chance: In other words, try to avoid plots that are entirely driven by combat when one or more of your players are detective types who strive to avoid combat.

bility, ultimately, all of the players will grow frustrated.
One of the most important implications of this rule is that you should strive to create adventures that give every player's character at least one chance to grab the spotlight.

DON'T COMPETE WITH THE PLAYERS

4. Underground i s not a contest. Remember, in role playing, there are
no winners and losers. As GM, your job is not to "beat" or humiliate the players, but to help them create an interesting story. There is absolutely no shame in losing a fight to the players or crafting a puzzle the players easily solve. In fact, both of these duties are a part of your job. Learn to look at the game as a cooperative rather than adversarial activity.

PREPARE YOUR ADVENTURE OUTLINES IN ADVANCE

5. Be Prepared. This rule has many implications. Before taking on the
responsibilities of GM, you should be fully familiar with this rulebook. Although the rules for a fully developed role playing game are invariably quite lengthy and almost no one can remember them all, you should make sure that you are intimately familiar with the game's basic rules and those that are used most often (in this case, combat, Challenges, Psychoses, and

Skill use; though you needn't necessarily familiarize yourself with each and every one of the Skill descriptions).
Similarly, unless you are an extremely skilled Gamemaster, you should take the time to plan out your story outlines and familiarize yourself with them before beginning play. You should also take a bit of time to think about how the players might react to your outline and plan some possible responses.

This simple step alone will improve the stories of many novice GMs.

FEEL FREE TO "BORROW" FROM OTHER SOURCES

6. Steal without Guilt. Don't be afraid to "borrow" plots, characters, settings, or ideas from television, movies, comics, or books. After all, if the resources are there, you may as well take advantage of them. Of course,

have seen, try your best to disguise your sources. Keeping the players guessing will make the game more fun for everybody.

Creating Story Outlines
A good story outline consists of at least the bare bones of a plot, a setting,
and some non-player characters:

*The plot should give you an idea of what is going to happen and why. Of course, it is impossible to know exactly what will happen until you see how the players react to your ideas and provide their own input, but you should spend some time thinking about possible outcomes and making appropriate plans. Sometimes, the players will confound all your plans and head in a totally unexpected direction. But

You should spend some time working out complete game statistics and somewhat detailed personalities for all the story's major NPCs (the antagonist, the vets' major allies, etc.) and you should give at least a little thought to most of the minor NPCs (ie. "there's a lonely bum who lives behind the antagonist's HQ; he doesn't know anything about the plot but will invent false information just to convince the players to stop and talk to him"). Again, you can't possibly

Note that it isn't really necessary to write all of this information down on

What is Underground About? - The Theme
Good stories feature a theme or issue they hope to explore. Underground was created to allow you to tell stories that examine the nature of heroism and how i t relates to culture. The four-color ''comic book" identities Underground vets assume in Slumberland are almost an ideal metaphor for the I lea -gaudy, larger than life, and naive. While the
UNDERGROUND

IS ABOUT
HEROISM

heroes created by other cultures were frequently their own worst enemies (Greek heroes had their tragic flaws, Lancelot and King Arthur had their falls from grace, the heroes of Japanese myth stood in constant conflict with the codes of honor they so revered), American heroes (from Paul Bunyan, to Superman, to all those muscle-bound gun-toters portrayed by Arnold Schwarzeneger) spend much of their time beating up "villains." To overcome a problem, the American hero must simply identify the proper villain and give him a smart punch in the nose.

ronment and how such changes attect society. In this way you'II not only create some dynamite stories, but you might encourage the players to reflect on some of the serious problems that plague our own world.

Of course, none of this is to say that every Underground story must explore
these themes. Feel free to explore just about any theme that interests you.

Your Goal When Creating a Story Outline
Your basic goal when creating a story outline, of course, i s to entertain yourself and the players. Generally, an entertaining story outline meets three criteria: it challenges the players, it challenges their characters, and it maintains the players' interest in the storyline.

use their wits: One of the easiest ways of forcing the players to use their wits is to create mystery adventures that force the players to put together a series of cluea to solve a crime or find a valuable object. An equally effective

CHALLENGING THE PLAYERS

Challenging the players means making them think. A role playing story can be looked upon as a large, complex puzzle. The players try to solve the puzzle by accomplishing the goal of the story (destroy a street gang, rescue a friend from terrorist kidnappers, etc). In order to accomplish the goal and solve the puzzle, the players must use their wits. NPCs shouldn't approach the players and sim-

technique is to design an adventure that features lots of tactical puzzles: how do we get in the locked room? how are we going to defeat all the Golemite's guards? etc.

ply tell them how to accomplish their goals. The players should be forced to
piece together sketchy clues and slowly unravel the story for themselves.

CHALLENGING THE PL4YERS FORCES THEM TO T O P E R l T E AND

One of the reasons why it is so important to challenge the players in this fashion is that there is nothing better at forcing players to cooperate than a good, challenging puzzle. Once you have presented the players with the clues they need to figure out where an important NPC is hiding, you'll find them talking amongst themselves and working together to solve their problem. Not only do such circumstances build a sense of cooperation and participation, they also nudge the players into interacting with each other in character, providing plenty of opportunities for good role playing.

ROLE PLAY

Challenging the players is often a difficult goal to achieve, so you should give a lot of thought to this aspect of your story outline. If your puzzles or mysteries are too easy, the players become bored and lose all sense of accomplishment. If, on the other hand, the puzzle is too difficult, the players become frustrated and lose interest in the story.

CHALLENGING THE PLAYERS' CHARACTERS

Challenging the players' characters i s usually much easier than challenging the players themselves. This time, it is the game-rated Abilities of the player characters (their Skills, Attributes, and Enhancements) you are testing. Most of the rules you've read up to this point show you how to do just that. Are the vets strong, fast, or determined enough to defeat the golemite's underbosses? Break out the combat rules and find out. Are the PCs fast enough to

catch the underbosses as they flee for their headquarters, or observant enough to notice the important matchbook cover they drop in their wake? Just ask for the appropriate Challenges. Each of these situations tests the capabilities of the players' characters instead of the players themselves.

The reason it i s important to test the abilities of the players' characters in addition to the abilities of the players goes all the way back to the central attraction of role playing games. RPGs allow you to "become" someone you are not, and this illusion is severely damaged unless you can call upon the capabilities of your alter ego. In other words, you c a n ' t really believe you're Tarzan until you start talking to animals and swinging from trees.

WHY TEST THE

PLAYERS
CHARACTERS?

Generally, most of the enjoyment of role playing comes from the GM's ability to keep the players interested in the storyline. Unfortunately, this is

KEEPING THE PLAYERS INTERESTED IN THE STORYLINE

by far the hardest goal to achieve. This is where
ctorytelling and acting abilities become imporIclnt. In most cases, good role playing stories resemble good books or movies. They have beginnings, middles, and ends, are suspenseful and atmospheric, are not predictable, and so forth. Keeping the players interested in the storyline is certainly the most important goal to consider when you are creating your story outlines. In fact, the previous two goals are really only a
Terrordome calls in a fender-bender on the L.A. Sky-Way.

means by which to accomplish this third goal. One of the easiest ways to keep players interested i n a story is to present them and their characters with a challenge.

One of the tools you have at your disposal when attempting to keep the players interested in a storyline is the interactive nature of the game itself. Role playing, remember, is storytelling by committee. If everything i s proceeding smoothly, your players should be having an impact of their own on the storyline. Since each player tends to deform the story in ways that interest her, part of your work is being done for you.

same player characters. Such a framework gives the players an opportunity to develop their characters over time, often resulting in an incredibly welldetailed cast.

The Campaign Goal
Before you sit down to play a campaign, you should gather all the players to make two very important decisions: how the player characters fit into the campaign and what they hope to accomplish.

background information: For instance, if the players decide to be members of a terrorist group, ask them to decide what cause they endorse; or if they are LA Peace Officers,

FIRST, HAVE THE PLkYERS DECIDE HOW THEY FIT INTO THE CAMPAIGN

*Deciding how the player characters fit into the campaign i s essentially equivalent to deciding how the players' characters are connected with each other (all work for the same organization, all served together, etc.) and what roles they will play in the campaign setting (police officers, members of a terrorist group, government operatives, corporate raiders, etc). At this time, you should also try to create as much background information about the player characters and their situation as possible.

make up a few NPCs (like superiors and desk sergeants) that inhabit their precinct house. At this point the players and GM should also agree on a setting for the campaign (Los Angeles, Luna, etc).

NEXT, HAVE THE PLAYERS SET A rhMPAIGN GOAL

*Once the players have decided how they fit into the campaign, they can now decide what they hope to accomplish.

This aspiration is known as the Campaign Goal. Once it has
been fulfilled, the players will select a new one. Campaign Goals can be large (topple the US Government) or small (rid a small Los Angeles neighborhood of crime). Generally, Campaign Goals are derived from the world background, either the information contained in this book and other Underground products, or the background generated by the

GM herself. For example, a group of terrorists might choose
"uniting the local Pre-Frontal population behind our cause," while a group of criminals might choose "Replacing Santa Claws as the crime kingpin on the west coast.'' Notice how both of these goals stem from specific background information about the world of 202 1 .

As GM, you shouldn't really interfere with either of these decisions. When it
comes to selecting their roles and choosing a Campaign Goal, give the players plenty of freedom. In the next section, you'll find guidelines that will help you figure out when it is time to allow the players to accomplish their Campaign Goal, allowing you to move on to the next goal.

Parameters and How To Use Them
Remember, Underground is about heroism and changing the world. To help the GM chart the vets' progress, we've created seven special categories known as Parameters that the GM can use to monitor the current state of

202 1 society. The seven Parameters are: Wealth, Safety, Government Purity,
Quality of Life, Education, Necessities, and Take Home Pay. Each of the Parameters is rated on a scale of 1-20. A high score (above 15) represents an area in which society is truly stable. A low score (below 5 ) represents an area i n which society is troubled.

Note that Parameters can be used to describe society on any imaginable scale. In other words, a neighborhood in Watts has a set of Parameters, the

PAWMETERS CAN RE USED ON ANY SCALE

city of Los Angeles has another set, the State of California has another set,
and the United States has still another set. Each locale's Parameters reflect conditions for the average resident of that locale. In other words, the Parameter ratings in Watts are truly abysmal while those of the United States are just bad, despite the fact that Watts is a part of the US.

TAKE HOME PAY

How to Use the Parameters
During play, the vets can temporarily alter the Parameters of the societies in which they operate by completing stories. As soon as the players set their Campaign Goal, the GM should set the Parameter ratings for the society the veterans are trying to effect. The GM should then set the Parameter levels necessary for the veterans to complete the goal. The difference between the society's original Parameter levels and the Parameter levels necessary for the completion of a goal should depend upon the magnitude of the accomplishment. Taking down a small-time criminal or seizing control of a very small government agency might require the levels to change by a couple of points, but overthrowing the US Government would require massive ( 1 0 point zhanges) in several of the Parameters.

Necessities: 6, and Take Home Pay: 10. The GM decides that the barriers that stand in the way of the AIDS problem are government corruption (tax dollars being misappropriated), corresponding to the Government Purity Parameter; insufficient access to medical care, corresponding to the

(

nvestor take over that crooked corporation on the other side of town, allow ng the corp to put more honest folk to work.'' If possible, this story sugge: ion should be connected to the Campaign Goal. If our vets pursuing thc xadication of AIDS wanted to increase the Education parameter fo nstance, they might suggest, "what if we tapped into the broadcast of thi Super Bowl and temporarily replaced it with an AIDS awareness message?"

GM might require that any
potential s t s t y idea is unacceptable unless it puts the player characters in some sort

The exact Total necessary to attempt a Parameter change depends upon thi jize of the society affected, as follows:

3f course, there i s a catch. Every time the players alter a Parameter Leve
:wo other levels are automatically altered as well (one Parameter lev6 increases and another decreases). Refer to the following chart:

If the players are attempting to decrease a Parameter Level, simply reverse
the results above. Decreasing Safety, for example, decreases Necessities and increases Quality of Life.

Note that these automatic alterations can either move the players closer to or further from their goals, depending upon the circumstances. A group trying to increase both Education and Wealth, for example, can

kill two birds with one stone.

SPENDING EXTRA

The only way to avoid these mandatory bumps is for
the players to spend triple the required number of Reward Points before attempting to alter a Parameter.

GOOD GMS GET A
FEEL FOR HOW
THEIR CAMPAIGN

Good GMs will reflect the changes in Parameter Levels within the stories they create, and might even draw inspiration for entire stories from Parameter changes. For example, if Safety is decreasing, random thugs and gang members will probably start showing up with greater regularity. Similarly, the
Undergrounder Kid Fury enters a nuclear power plant in Palo Alto.

WORLDS ARE EVOLVING BY
WATCHING THE PARAMETERS

GM might interpret a decrease in Government Purity to indicate that a new
corrupt politician has appeared on the scene, perhaps inspiring a few workable story outlines.

Similarly, the GM should feel free to arbitrarily alter the society Parameters based upon campaign events she i s planning or the unexpected outcome of a story. For instance, right in the middle of a campaign, the GM might decide that an epidemic of a rare South American disease strikes the city,

running the game

lowering Quality of Life by 2 levels. Or, should President Foster unexpectedly die during one of the group's stories, the GM should raise and lower all sorts of Parameter levels as appropriate.

GMs begin envisioning this
ending back when the Campaign Goal is chosen. For instance, to return to our AIDS example, the GM might decide that the players will finally eradicate AIDS in LA County by proving that the City Health Administrator is corrupt, removing him from his job, and allowing a more concerned candidate to assume the position. The GM can then begin foreshadowing the end

Achieving the Campaign Goal
Once the group makes an attempt at the final alteration they need to achieve their goal, the GM should create and run a story that finally allows the group to achieve the Campaign Goal. Once the goal has been achieved, the players then select a new goal and the whole procedure starts all over again. Once a Goal has been completed, the society's altered Parameters return to their beginning values and the whole thing starts all over again.

ONCE A GOAL IS ACHIEVED, THE

of the campaign several
adventures early by dropping hints about the Administrator's corruption, etc. This process is important because it gives the players something to irork ivith when they are trying to
suggest story ideas to the GM.

Optionally, the players can permanently alter a Parameter by spending fives times the normal Reward Point cost of doing so.

Other Uses for Reward Points
Reward Points also have a few additional uses:

Note that this option can only be used to increase pre-existing Enhancements, not to install new ones. Increasing Enhancements in this fashion does not alter the Enhancement's Stress Rating.

*And Spending Five Reward Points buys a player an additional Karma Point.

Note that several other uses for Reward Points will be introduced in the Underground Player's Handbook due out in early 1994.

. -

Traits, Codes, and Reward Points
The number of Reward Points a character earns for participating in a story i s influenced by how well she lived up to her Traits and Codes. Violating a Trait cuts the number of Reward Points earned in half (fractions rounded down), while violating a Code prevents the character from earning any Reward Points at all. In other words, a character with the Trait "Curiosity" who is confronted with a mystery during a story and makes no attempt to solve it, receives half the Reward Points he i s entitled to. Similarly, a character with the Code "Always avenges injustices in kind" who makes no effort to avenge an obvious injustice during a story, receives no Reward Points at all. It i s always up to the Gamemaster to determine whether or not a Trait or Code has been violated.
