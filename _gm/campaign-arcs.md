## Overview

The Housing Crisis campaign is structured as three distinct arcs spanning 20 sessions. Each arc escalates in scope and stakes while maintaining focus on transforming Paradise Heights.

**Pacing Goal:** +2-3 QoL points per session average = 40-60 point gain over 20 sessions

## Arc 1: Street-Level Threats (Sessions 1-7)

**Core Concept:** Establish power base, deal with immediate threats, gain resident trust

**Starting QoL:** 12  
**Target End QoL:** 24-28

### Session 1: Welcome to Paradise

- First encounter with Rent-A-Cops (extortion attempt)
- Meet key resident NPCs (Maria, Old Sam, maybe young resident)
- First gang encounter (establish threat level)

**Stakes:** Establish reputation (protectors or threats?)

### Session 4: Rent-A-Cop Shakedown

**Key Beats:**
- Captain Webb demands "protection tax" from residents
- Elderly resident beaten for non-payment
- PCs confront Rent-A-Cops (violence likely)
- Choice: drive them out completely (escalates) or intimidate into backing off

## Pacing Notes

**Sessions 1-7:** Focus on immediate threats, establish tone  
**Sessions 8-14:** Build systems, create hope  
**Sessions 15-20:** Test everything, earn the ending

**Key Principle:** Every session should advance Social Change stats visibly

**Flexibility:** Adjust based on player choices and dice rolls, but keep moving toward session 20 confrontation

*The arc structure gives players a clear progression: stabilize → build → defend. Each phase escalates stakes while maintaining focus on the neighborhood.*
