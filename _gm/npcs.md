## Using NPCs Effectively

**Residents:**
- Show consequences of player choices
- Provide emotional stakes
- Celebrate victories, mourn failures
- Make Paradise Heights feel real

**Gangs:**
- Not cartoon villains—desperate people doing bad things
- Can be redeemed, negotiated with, or destroyed
- Player choice determines their fate

**Corporations:**
- The real enemy—institutional, systemic
- Can't be punched into submission
- Must be outmaneuvered or exposed
- Victory is forcing them to back down, not destroying them

**Key Principle:** NPCs should feel like people, not quest givers or obstacles
