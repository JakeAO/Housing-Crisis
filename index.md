## The Premise

You're a "Slushie"—a genetically engineered super-soldier who survived the secret wars. The government promised you luxury accommodations in "Veteran's Paradise," a state-of-the-art complex with every amenity. Instead, they dumped you in a crumbling, gang-infested housing project in the worst part of Neo-L.A.

Welcome to Paradise Heights. The elevators don't work. The water's contaminated. Corporate-sponsored gangs control the streets. Rent-A-Cops shake down residents for "protection fees." The "luxury amenities" are a joke—if they exist at all.

But you didn't survive bioengineering and combat conditioning to live in a warzone. You and your fellow Slushies are going to fix this place. Block by block. Building by building. Whatever it takes.

The corporations won't like it. The gangs won't go quietly. The corrupt cops will push back. And when Paradise Heights starts looking *too* nice, the original developers will want their land back.

Twenty sessions. One neighborhood. Can you turn hell into paradise before the corporate siege begins?

## Campaign Structure

**Arc 1: Street-Level Threats (Sessions 1-7)**  
Deal with local gangs, corrupt Rent-A-Cops, and immediate survival needs. Establish your power base and start building community trust.

**Arc 2: Infrastructure Building (Sessions 8-14)**  
Secure clean water, food sources (alternatives to Tastee-Goo), medical supplies, and essential services. "Liberate" resources from corporate warehouses. Implement Social Change mechanics to improve neighborhood stats.

**Arc 3: Corporate Pushback (Sessions 15-20)**  
Success has made Paradise Heights visible. The corporations want their valuable real estate back. Prepare for and survive a massive corporate siege while maintaining everything you've built.

## Atmosphere

- **Satirical Cyberpunk:** Exaggerated corporate dystopia with biting social commentary
- **Urban Warfare:** Street-level combat, tactical thinking, and creative power usage
- **1990s Aesthetic:** Concrete brutalism, neon signs, crass product placement everywhere
- **Social Change:** Your actions directly improve (or harm) neighborhood statistics
- **Dark Humor:** Hopeful resistance against overwhelming corporate absurdity

## Themes

**What makes this campaign unique:**
- The **Social Change system** tracks neighborhood improvement across 8 statistics (Safety, Employment, Health, Infrastructure, Education, Morale, Crime, Corruption)
- **Slushies** are powerful but traumatized—superhuman abilities meet PTSD and broken promises
- **Corporate satire** everywhere—Tastee-Goo, Rent-A-Cops, privatized everything, media manipulation
- **Community building** as the core gameplay loop—you're not just fighting, you're fixing a broken society
- **Escalating threats** from street gangs to full corporate warfare over 20 sessions

## System

This campaign uses **Underground**, Ray Winninger's satirical superhero RPG set in a dystopian near-future. The system emphasizes creative power usage, social mechanics, and the consequences of collateral damage. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules and resources.
