## The Premise

You're a kid in Autumn Hollow, a small town where October 31st, 1986 never ends. Every morning you wake up to the same autumn day—leaves falling, jack-o'-lanterns on porches, and Halloween decorations lining Main Street. Most people don't notice. But you do.

Something is wrong with your town. Time is broken. And the adults either can't see it or won't talk about it.

Maybe it started when that thing fell from the sky three nights ago—or was it three hundred nights ago? The stars look different now. Wrong. Like they're watching. And at the edge of town, in the woods past Miller's Creek, there's something that definitely wasn't there before. Something that doesn't belong in this world.

You and your friends are the only ones who remember. You're the only ones who know the loop resets every night at midnight. And you're the only ones who can figure out why.

## Atmosphere

- **Small Town 1980s:** Bike rides, arcade games, walkie-talkies, and BMX jumps
- **Eternal Autumn:** Orange leaves, pumpkin patches, harvest festivals frozen in time
- **Coming-of-Age:** Friendship, growing up, facing fears, and protecting what matters
- **Cosmic Horror:** Ancient forces, impossible geometries, and truths too vast to comprehend
- **Time Loop Mystery:** Repeating days, gathering clues, and trying to break the cycle

## Themes

**What makes this campaign unique:**
- The **time loop** creates urgency—you can experiment and fail, but you must make progress
- **Cosmic horror** mixed with kid protagonists creates vulnerability and wonder
- **Autumn setting** provides cozy small-town atmosphere against creeping dread  
- **1980s nostalgia** grounds the weird in familiar touchstones
- **Coming-of-age story** about kids becoming heroes when adults can't or won't help

## System

This campaign uses **Kids On Bikes**, a narrative RPG system designed for young protagonists solving mysteries in small-town settings. The system emphasizes collaborative storytelling, simple dice mechanics, and the power of friendship. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules and resources.
